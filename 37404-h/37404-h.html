            conciliatory toward Protestantism, while abandoning nothing
            essential in the Greek Orthodox creed, and showing signs of the
            possession of independent speculative power. Afterwards

            restrained its violence, but did not prevent secret machinations
            and the open exercise of all conceivable arts of seduction. Next
            to the conversion of Bohemia, the greatest triumph of the
            restoration was won in France in the Revocation of the Edict of
            Nantes. Besides such victories the Catholics were able to glory
            in the conversion of several Protestant princes. New endeavours
            at union were repeatedly made, but these in every case proved as
            fruitless as former attempts had done.</p>

            qualify himself for the Polish crown; but the rights of his
            Protestant subjects were carefully guarded. An awkwardness arose

            were torn down, vast numbers of confessors were tortured, burnt,

            against emigrating, in spite of the watch kept over the

            open arms as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            Holland, England, Denmark, and Switzerland. Many fled into the

            maintained a heroic conflict for years, until at last
            exterminated by an army at least ten times their strength. The

            fanatical and inhumanly cruel inquisitor, the Abbé du Chaila, was
            slain. At the head of the Camisard army was a young peasant, Jean
            Cavalier, who by his energetic and skilful conduct of the
            campaign astonished the world. At last the famous Marshal
            Villars, by promising a general amnesty, release of all
            prisoners, permission to emigrate with possessions, and religious
            toleration to those who remained, succeeded in persuading
            Cavalier to lay down his arms. The king ratified this bargain,

            submitted; while others emigrated, mostly to England. Cavalier
            entered the king's service as colonel; but distrusting the
            arrangements fled to Holland, and afterwards to England, where in

            of her most pious, industrious, and capable inhabitants, and yet
            two millions of Huguenots deprived of all their rights remained

            released prisoners and Irish refugees, driven from their native
            land by Cromwell's severities, to whom the duke had given shelter
            in the valleys, perpetrated the most horrible cruelties. Yet in
            the desperate conflict the Waldensians held their ground. The
            intervention of the Protestant Swiss cantons won for them again a
            measure of toleration, and liberal gifts from abroad compensated
            them for their loss of property. Cromwell too sent to the relief
            of the sufferers the celebrated Lord Morland in <span class=

            valleys he got possession of a number of MSS. (§ 108, 11), which

            of Louis XIV. The soldiers besieged the valleys, and more than
            14,000 captives were consigned to fortresses and prisons. But the
            rest of the Waldensians plucked up courage, inflicted many
            defeats upon their enemy, and so moved the government in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            to Germany, others fled to Switzerland. These last, aided by
            Swiss troops, and led by their own pastor, Henry Arnaud, made an

            still greater. He therefore rigorously suppressed the Jesuits,
            who disputed the royal supremacy over the church; and the
            bitterness of the Catholics now reached its height. They
            organized the so-called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Gunpowder Plot</span></em>, with the
            intention of blowing up the royal family and the whole Parliament
            at the first meeting of the house. At the head of the conspiracy
            stood Rob. Catesby, Thomas Percy of Northumberland, and Guy
            Fawkes, an English officer in the Spanish service. The plan was
            discovered shortly before the day appointed for its execution. On
            November 5th, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1605, Fawkes, with
            lantern and matches, was seized in the cellar. The rest of the
            conspirators fled, but, after a desperate struggle, in which
            Catesby and Percy fell, were arrested, and, together with two
            Jesuit accomplices, executed as traitors. Great severities were
            then exercised toward the Catholics, not only in England, but
            also in Ireland, where the bulk of the population was attached to
            the Romish faith. James I. completed the transference of
            ecclesiastical property to the Anglican church, and robbed the
            Irish nobles of almost all their estates, and gifted them over to
            Scottish and English favourites. All Catholics, because they

            ineligible for any civil office. These oppressions at last led to
            the fearful <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1641, a desperate
            outbreak of the Catholics took place throughout the country. It
            aimed at the destruction of all Protestants in Ireland. The
            conspirators rushed from all sides into the houses of the
            Protestants, murdered the inhabitants, and drove them naked and
            helpless from their homes. Many thousands died on the roadside of
            hunger and cold. In other places they were driven in crowds into
            the rivers and drowned, or into empty houses, which were burnt
            over them. The number of those who suffered is variously
            estimated from 40,000 to 400,000. Charles I., <span class=

            suspected as instigator of this terrible deed, and it may be
            regarded as his first step toward the scaffold (<a href=
            "#Section_155_Para_1" class="tei tei-ref">§ 155, 1</a>). After

            of Parliament, took fearful revenge for the Irish crime. In the
            two cities which he took by storm he had all the citizens cut
            down without distinction. Panic-stricken, the inhabitants of the
            other cities fled to the bogs. Within nine months the whole
            island was reconquered. Hundreds of thousands, driven from their
            native soil, wandered as homeless fugitives, and their lands were
            divided among English soldiers and settlers. During the time of
            the English Commonwealth, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            toleration, not only for all Christian sects, but also for Jews
            and Mohammedans, and even atheists, were now at one in excluding
            Catholics from its benefit, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            the bidding of a foreign sovereign.—The Restoration under Charles
            II. could not greatly ameliorate the calamities of the Irish.
            Religious persecution indeed ceased, but the property taken from
            the Catholic church and native owners still remained in the hands
            of the Anglican church and the Protestant occupiers. To
            counterbalance the Catholic proclivities of Charles II. (<a href=
            "#Section_155_Para_3" class="tei tei-ref">§ 155, 3</a>), the
            English Parliament of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Test
            Act</span></em>, which required every civil and military officer
            to take the test oaths, condemning transubstantiation and the
            worship of the saints, and to receive the communion according to
            the Anglican rite as members of the State church. The statements
            of a certain Titus Oates, that the Jesuits had organized a plot
            for murdering the king and restoring the papacy, led to fearful
            riots in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            executions. But the reports were seemingly unfounded, and were
            probably the fruit of an intrigue to deprive the king's Catholic
            brother, James II., of the right of succession. When James

            his feelings were completely changed. He now invariably expressed
            himself more favourably in regard to the faith and the

            King Wladislaus IV. of Poland thought a union of Protestants and
            Catholics in his dominions not impossible, and with this end in

            Brandenburg were also invited to take part in it. The elector
            sent his court preacher, John Berg, and asked from the Duke of
            Brunswick the assistance of the Helmstadt theologian, George
            Calixt. The chief representatives of the Lutheran side were
            Abraham Calov, of Danzig, and John Hülsemann, of Wittenberg. That
            Calixt, a Lutheran, took the part of the Reformed, intensified
            the bitterness of the Lutherans at the outset. The result was to
            increase the split on all sides. The Reformed set forth their

            Meaux, used all his eloquence to prepare a way for the return of
            Protestants to the church in which alone is salvation. In several
            treatises he gave an idealized exposition of the Catholic
            doctrine, glossed over what was most offensive to Protestants,
            and sought by subtlety and sophistry to represent the Protestant

            had come into the country as father confessor of the empress,
            proposed a scheme of union at the imperial court. The
            controverted points were to be decided at a free council, but the
            primacy of the pope and the hierarchical system, as founded

            travelled through all Protestant Germany. He found most success,
            out of respect for the emperor, in Hanover, where the Abbot of
            Loccum, Molanus, zealously advocated the proposed union, in which
            on the Catholic side Bossuet, on the Protestant side the great
            philosopher <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Leibnitz</span></em>, took part. But the
            negotiations ended in no practical result. That Leibnitz had
            himself been already secretly inclined to Catholicism, some think
            to have proved by a manuscript, found after his death, entitled

            was to investigate and recognise what was profound and true even
            in Catholicism, so that he reached the conviction that neither of
            the two churches had given perfect and adequate expression to
            Christian truth, he has apparently sought in this work to make

            what and how much of specifically Catholic doctrines were
            justifiable, and to sketch out a system of doctrine occupying a
            place superior to both confessions. In this treatise many
            doctrines are expressed in a manner quite divergent from that of
            the Tridentine creed, while several expressions show how clearly
            he perceived the contradiction between his own Protestant faith
            and the Romish system, amid all his attempts to effect a

            Brandenburg, it characterized with historical accuracy in 100
            Leonine verses the Brandenburg princes down to Frederick III., of
            whose coronation in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            ignorant, and after this proceeds in a purely fanciful and
            arbitrary manner. From Joachim II., who openly joined the
            Reformation, it enumerates eleven members, so that the history is
            just brought down to Frederick William III. With the eleventh the
            Hohenzollern dynasty ends, Germany is united, the Catholic church
            restored, and Lehnin raised again to its ancient glory. Under
            Frederick William IV., the Catholics diligently sought to prove
            the genuineness of the prophecy, and by arbitrary methods to
            extend it so as to include this prince. Lately <span class=

            the greater part of Philip's territory and the northern half of

            union and levelling tendencies, and by means of general synods
            wrought eagerly to secure acceptance for them throughout Hesse by
            setting aside the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            "la"><span style="font-style: italic">Corpus Doctrinæ
            Philippicum</span></span> (§ 142, 10). The fourth and last of
            those general synods was held in 1582. Further procedure was
            meanwhile rendered impossible by the increase of opposition. For,
            on the one hand, Louis IV., under the influence of the acute and
            learned but contentious Ægidius Hunnius, professor of theology at
            Marburg, 1576-1592, became more and more decidedly a
            representative of exclusive Lutheranism; and, on the other hand,
            William's Calvinizing schemes became from day to day more
            reckless. His son and successor <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Maurice</span></em> went forward more
            energetically along the same lines as his father, especially
            after the death of his uncle Louis in 1604, who bequeathed to him
            the Marburg part of his territories. These had been given him on
            condition that he should hold by the confession and its apology
            as guaranteed by Charles V. in 1530. But in 1605 he forbad the
            Marburg theologians to set forth the ubiquity theology; and when
            they protested, issued a formal prohibition of the dogma with its
            presuppositions and consequences, and insisted on the
            introduction of the Reformed numbering of the commandments of the
            decalogue, and the breaking of bread at the communion, and the
            removal of the remaining images from the churches (§ 144, 2). The
            theologians again protested, and were deprived of their offices.
            The result was the outbreak of a popular tumult at Marburg, which
            Maurice suppressed by calling in the military. When in several
            places in Upper and even in Lower Hesse opposition was persisted
            in, and the resisting clergy could not be won over either by
            persuasion and threatening or by persecution, Maurice in 1607
            convened consultative diocesan synods at Cassel, Eschwege,
            Marburg, St. Goar, and soon after a general synod at Cassel,
            which, giving expression on all points to the will of the
            landgrave, drew up, besides a new hymnbook and catechism, a new
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Christian and correct confession of
            faith,”</span> by which they openly and decidedly declared their
            attachment to the Reformed church. Soon Hesse accepted these
            conclusions, but not the rest of the state, where the opposition
            of the nobles, clergy, and people, in spite of all attempts to
            enforce this acceptance by military power, imprisonment, and
            deposition, could not be altogether overcome.—Meanwhile George's
            son and successor, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Louis V.</span></em>, 1596-1626, had been
            eagerly seeking to make capital <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            in favour of the Darmstadt dynasty. He gave his protection to the
            professors expelled from Marburg in 1605, founded in 1607 a
            Lutheran university at Giessen, and made accusations against his
            cousin before the imperial supreme court, which in 1623, on the
            basis of the will of Louis IV. and the Religious Peace of
            Augsburg (§ 137, 5), declared the inheritance forfeited, and
            entrusted the electors of Cologne and Saxony with the execution
            of the sentence. These in conjunction with the troops of the
            league under Tilly attacked Upper and Lower Hesse; the Lutheran
            University of Giessen was transferred to Marburg, and Upper
            Hesse, after the banishment of the Reformed pastors, went over
            wholly to the Lutheran confession. Maurice, completely broken
            down, resigned in favour of his son <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">William
            V.</span></em>, who was obliged to make an agreement, according
            to which he made over Upper Hesse, Schmalcald, and Katzenelnbogen
            to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            the successor of Louis V. In consequence of his attachment to
            Gustavus Adolphus in the Thirty Years' War the ban of the empire
            was pronounced upon William. He died in 1637. His widow,
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Amalie
            Elizabeth</span></em>, undertook the government on behalf of her
            young son William VI., and in 1646, after repeated victories over
            George's troops, made a new agreement with him, by which the
            territories taken away in 1627 were restored to Hesse-Cassel,
            under a guarantee, however, that the <span lang="la" class=

            religion should be preserved, and that they should continue
            predominantly Lutheran. The university property was divided;
            Giessen obtained a Lutheran, Marburg a Reformed institution, and
            Lower Hesse received a moderately but yet essentially Reformed
            ecclesiastical constitution.</p>

            outbreak of the English Revolution, occasioned by the despotism
            of the first two Stuarts, crowds of Puritan exiles returned from
            Holland and North America to their old home. They powerfully
            strengthened their secret sympathisers in their successful
            struggle against the episcopacy of the State church (§ 131, 6);
            but, breaking up into rival parties, as Presbyterians and
            Independents (§ 143, 3, 4), gave way to fanatical extravagances.
            The victorious party of Independents also split into two
            divisions: the one, after the old Dutch style, simple and strict
            believers in Scripture; the other, first in Cromwell's army,
            fanatical enthusiasts and visionary saints (<a href=
            "#Section_161_Para_1" class="tei tei-ref">§ 161, 1</a>). The
            Restoration, under the last two Stuarts, sought to re-introduce
            Catholicism. It was William of Orange, by his Act of Toleration
            of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            beyond his father in theory and practice, and thus incurred the
            hatred of his Protestant subjects. William Laud, from
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1633 Archbishop of
            Canterbury, was the recklessly zealous promoter of his despotic
            ideas, representing the Episcopacy, by reason of its Divine
            institution and apostolic succession, as the foundation of the
            church and the pillar of an absolute monarchy. Laud used his
            position as primate to secure the introduction of his own theory
            into the public church services, among other things making the
            communion office an imitation as near as possible of the Romish
            mass. But when he attempted to force upon the Scotch such
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Baal-worship”</span> by the command of
            the king, they formed a league in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1638 for the
            defence of Presbyterianism, the so called Great Covenant, and
            emphasised their demand by sending an army into England. The
            king, who had ruled for eleven years without a Parliament, was
            obliged now to call together the representatives of the people.
            Scarcely had the Long Parliament, <span class=

            the Puritan element was supreme, pacified the Scotch, than oil
            was anew poured on the flames by the Irish massacre of
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            "#Section_153_Para_6" class="tei tei-ref">§ 153, 6</a>). The
            Lower House, in spite of the persistent opposition of the court,
            resolved on excluding the bishops from the Upper House and
            formally abolishing Episcopacy; and in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1643, summoned the
            Westminster Assembly to remodel the organization of the English
            church, at which Scotch representatives were to have a seat.
            After long and violent debates with an Independent minority, till
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1648, the Assembly
            drew up a Presbyterian constitution with a Puritan service, and
            in the Westminster Confession a strictly Calvinistic creed. But
            only in Scotland were these decisions heartily accepted. In
            England, notwithstanding their confirmation by the Parliament,
            they received only partial and occasional acceptance, owing to
            the prevalence of Independent opinions among the people.—Since
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1642, the tension
            between court and Parliament had brought about the Civil War
            between Cavaliers and Roundheads. In <span class=

            troops were cut to pieces at Naseby by the parliamentary army
            under Fairfax and Cromwell. The king fled to <span class=

            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1647. But when now
            the fanatical Independents, who formed a majority in the army,
            began to terrorise the Parliament, it opened negotiations for
            peace with the king. He was now ready to make almost any
            sacrifice, only on religious and conscientious grounds he could
            not agree to the unconditional abandonment of Episcopacy. Even
            the Scotch, whose Presbyterianism was now threatened by the
            Independents, as before it had been by the Episcopalians, longed
            for the restoration of royalty, and to aid in this sent an army
            into England in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1648. But they were
            defeated by Cromwell, who then dismissed the Parliament and had
            all its Presbyterian members either imprisoned or driven into
            retirement. The Independent remnant, known as the Rump

            speech, two hours in length, on God's ways and judgments, the
            Short or Barebones' Parliament, composed of <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“pious and God-fearing men”</span> selected by
            himself. In this new Parliament which, with prayer and
            psalm-singing, wrought hard at the re-organization of the
            executive, the bench, and the church, the two parties of
            Independents were represented, the fanatical enthusiasts indeed
            predominating, and so victorious in all matters of debate. To
            this party Cromwell himself belonged. His attachment to it,
            however, was considerably cooled in consequence of the excesses
            of the Levellers (<a href="#Section_161_Para_2" class=
            "tei tei-ref">§ 161, 2</a>), and the fantastic policy of the
            parliamentarian Saints disgusted him more and more. When
            therefore, on December 12th, <span class=

            1653, after five months' fruitless opposition to the radical
            demands of the extravagant majority, all the most moderate
            members of the Parliament had resigned their seats and returned
            their mandates into Cromwell's hands, he burst in upon
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page017">[pg 017]</span><a name=
            "Pg017" id="Pg017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the psalm-singing
            remnant with his soldiers, and entered upon his life-long office
            of the Protector of the Commonwealth with a new constitution. He
            proclaimed toleration of all religious sects, Catholics only
            being excepted on political grounds (<a href=
            "#Section_153_Para_6" class="tei tei-ref">§ 153, 6</a>), giving
            equal rights to Presbyterians, and offering no hindrance to the
            revival of Episcopacy. He yet remained firmly attached to his
            early convictions. He believed in a kingdom of the saints
            embracing the whole earth, and looked on England as destined for
            the protection and spread of Protestantism. Zürich greeted him as
            the great Protestant champion, and he showed himself in this
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">rôle</span></span> in the valleys of
            Piedmont (<a href="#Section_153_Para_5" class="tei tei-ref">§
            153, 5</a>), in France, in Poland, and in Silesia. He joined with
            all Protestant governments into a league, offensive and
            defensive, against fanatical attempts of Papists to recover their
            lost ground. When Spain and France sued for his alliance, he made
            it a condition with the former that, besides allowing free trade
            with the West Indies, it should abolish the Inquisition; and of
            France he required an assurance that the rights of Huguenots
            should be respected. And when in Germany a new election of
            emperor was to take place, he urged the great electors that they
            should by no means allow the imperial throne to continue with the
            Catholic house of Austria. Meanwhile his path at home was a
            thorny one. He was obliged to suppress fifteen open rebellions
            during five years of his reign, countless secret plots threatened
            his life every day, and his bitterest foes were his former
            comrades in the camp of the the saints. After refusing the crown
            offered him in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            with the reinstating of the Episcopal church in all the
            privileges granted to it under Elizabeth. The Corporation Act of
            December, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1661, was the first
            of a series of enactments for this purpose. It required of all
            magistrates and civil officers that they should take an oath
            acknowledging the royal supremacy and communicate in the
            Episcopal church. The Act of Uniformity of May, <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1662, was still
            more oppressive. It prohibited any clergyman entering the English
            pulpit or discharging any ministerial function, unless he had
            been ordained by a bishop, had signed the Thirty-nine Articles,
            and undertook to conduct worship <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page018">[pg 018]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> exactly in accordance with the newly
            revised Book of Common Prayer. More than 2,000 Puritan ministers,
            who could not conscientiously submit to those terms, were driven
            out of their churches. Then in June, <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1664, the
            Conventicle Act was renewed, enforcing attendance at the
            Episcopal church, and threatening with imprisonment or exile all
            found in any private religious meeting of more than five persons.
            In the following year the Five Mile Act inflicted heavy fines on
            all nonconformist ministers who should approach within five miles
            of their former congregation or indeed of any city. All these
            laws, although primarily directed against all Protestant
            dissenters, told equally against the Catholics, whom the king's
            Catholic sympathies would willingly have spared. When now his
            league with Catholic France against the Protestant Netherlands
            made it necessary for him to appease his Protestant subjects, he
            hoped to accomplish this and save the Catholics by his
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Declaration of Indulgence”</span> of
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1672, issued with
            the consent of Parliament, which suspended all penal laws
            hitherto in force against dissenters. But the Protestant
            nonconformists saw through this scheme, and the Parliament of
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1673 passed the
            anti-Catholic Test Act (<a href="#Section_153_Para_6" class=
            "tei tei-ref">§ 153, 6</a>). Equally vain were all later attempts
            to secure greater liberties and privileges to the Catholics. They
            only served to develop the powers of Parliament and to bring the
            Episcopalians and nonconformists more closely together. After
            spending his whole life oscillating between frivolous unbelief
            and Catholic superstition, Charles II., on his death-bed,
            formally went over to the Romish church, and had the communion
            and extreme unction administered by a Catholic priest. His
            brother and successor <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            "tei tei-hi"><span style=

            from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1672 an avowed
            Catholic, sent a declaration of obedience to Rome, received a
            papal nuncio in London, and in the exercise of despotic power
            issued, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1687, a
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Declaration of Freedom of
            Conscience,”</span> which, under the fair colour of universal
            toleration and by the setting aside of the test oath, enabled him
            to fill all civil and military offices with Catholics. This act
            proved equally oppressive to the Episcopalians and to Protestant
            dissenters. This intrigue cost him his throne. He had, as he
            himself said, staked three kingdoms on a mass, and lost all the
            three. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            of Charles I. and son-in-law of James II., gave a final decision
            to the rights of the national Episcopal church and the position
            of dissenters in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Act of Toleration</span></em> of
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1689, which he
            passed with consent of the Parliament. All penal laws against the
            latter were abrogated, and religious liberty was extended to all
            with the exception of Catholics and Socinians. The retention of
            the Corporation and Test Acts, however, still excluded them from
            the exercise of all political rights. They were also still
            obliged to pay tithes and other church dues to the Episcopal
            clergy of their <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page019">[pg

            dioceses, and their marriages and baptisms had to be administered
            in the parish churches. Their ministers were also obliged to
            subscribe the Thirty-nine Articles, with reservation of those
            points opposed to their principles. The Act of Union of
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1707, passed under
            Queen Anne, a daughter of James II., which united England and
            Scotland into the one kingdom of Great Britain, gave legitimate
            sanction to a separate ecclesiastical establishment for each
            country. In Scotland the Presbyterian churches continued the
            established church, while the Episcopal was tolerated as a
            dissenting body. Congregationalism, however, has been practically
            limited to England and North America,<a id="noteref_12" name=

            Notwithstanding the regeneration of papal Catholicism since the
            middle of the sixteenth century, Hildebrand's politico-theocratic
            ideal was not realized. Even Catholic princes would not be
            dictated to on political matters by the vicar of Christ. The most
            powerful of them, France, Austria, and Spain, during the
            sixteenth century, and subsequently also Portugal, had succeeded
            in the claim to the right of excluding objectionable candidates
            in papal elections. Ban and interdict had lost their power. The
            popes, however, still clung to the idea after they had been
            obliged to surrender the reality, and issued from time to time
            powerless protestations against disagreeable facts of history.
            Several new monkish orders were instituted during this century,
            mostly for teaching the young and tending the sick, but some also
            expressly for the promoting of theological science. Of all the
            orders, new and old, the Jesuits were by far the most powerful.
            They were regarded with jealousy and suspicion by the other
            orders. In respect of doctrine the Dominicans <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page020">[pg 020]</span><a name="Pg020" id=
            "Pg020" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> were as far removed from them
            as possible within the limits of the Tridentine Creed. But
            notwithstanding any such mutual jealousies, they were all
            animated by one yearning desire to oppose, restrict, and, where
            that was possible, to uproot Protestantism. With similar zeal
            they devoted themselves with wonderful success to the work of
            foreign missions.</p>

            the Propaganda, prescribed a secret scrutiny in papal elections,
            and canonized Loyola, Xavier, and Neri. He enriched the Vatican
            Library by the addition of the valuable treasures of the
            Heidelberg Library, which Maximilian I. of Bavaria sent him on
            his conquest of the Palatinate. <em class=

            compelled Galileo to recant. But on the other hand, through his
            onesided ecclesiastical policy he was led into sacrificing the
            interests of the imperial house of Austria. Not only did he fail
            to give support to the emperor, but quite openly hailed Gustavus
            Adolphus, the saviour of German Protestantism, as the God-sent
            saviour from the Spanish-Austrian tyranny. For this he was
            pronounced a heretic at the imperial court, and threatened with a
            second edition of the sack of Rome (§ 132, 2). At the same time
            his soul was so filled with fanatical hatred against
            Protestantism, that in a letter of 1631 he congratulated the
            Emperor Ferdinand II. on the destruction of Magdeburg as an act
            most pleasing to heaven and reflecting the highest credit upon
            Germany, and expressed the hope that the glory of so great a
            victory should not be restricted to the ruins of a single city.
            On receiving the news of the death of Gustavus Adolphus in 1632
            he broke out into loud jubilation, saying that now <span class=

            sought to destroy the whole world.”</span> His successor,

            powerful pope, zealously promoting the weal of the church and the
            Papal States by introducing discipline among the clergy and
            attacking the immorality that prevailed among all classes of
            society. He unhesitatingly condemned sixty-five propositions from
            the lax Jesuit code of morals. Against the arrogant ambassador of
            Louis XIV., he energetically maintained his sovereign rights in
            his own domains, while he unreservedly refused the claims of the
            French clergy, urged by the king on the ground of the exceptional
            constitution of the Gallican church. <em class=

            influence obtained by them over public affairs through school and
            confessional, and their vast wealth accumulated from bequests and
            donations, led the government, in <span class=

            their receiving legacies or erecting new cloisters. In vain did
            Paul V. remonstrate. He then put Venice under an interdict. The
            Jesuits sought to excite the people against the government, and
            for this were banished in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            months' vain endeavour to enforce the interdict, the pope at
            last, through French mediation, concluded a peace with the
            republic, without, however, being able to obtain either the
            abolition of the objectionable ecclesiastico-political laws or
            permission for the return of the Jesuits. Only after the republic
            had been weakened through the unfortunate Turkish war of

            campaign; but when Alexander VII. suppressed several rich
            cloisters, their revenues were thankfully accepted for this
            purpose. In <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            dogmatics against the Jansenists (§§ <a href=
            "#Section_156_Para_5" class="tei tei-ref">156, 5</a>; 164, 7), he
            was by no means unfaithful to the traditional ecclesiastical
            polity of his house (§§ 96, 21; 110, 1, 9, 13, 14), and was often
            irritated to the utmost pitch by the pope's opposition to his
            political interests. He rigorously insisted upon the old
            customary right of the Crown to the income of certain vacant
            ecclesiastical offices, the <span lang="la" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">jus regaliæ</span></span>, and extended it
            to all bishoprics, burdened church revenues with military
            pensions, confiscated ecclesiastical property, etc. Innocent XI.
            energetically protested against such exactions. The king then had
            an assembly of the French called together in Paris on March 19th,
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1682, which issued
            the famous <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Four Propositions of the Gallican
            Clergy</span></span>, drawn up by Bishop Bossuet of Meaux. These
            set forth the fundamental rights of the French church: (1) In
            secular affairs the pope has no jurisdiction over princes and
            kings, and cannot release their subjects from their allegiance;
            (2) The spiritual power of the pope is subject to the higher
            authority of the general councils; (3) For France it is further
            limited by the old French ecclesiastical laws; and, (4) Even in
            matters of faith the judgment of the pope without the approval of
            a general assembly of the church is not unalterable. Innocent
            consequently refused to institute any of the newly appointed
            bishops. He was not even appeased by the Revocation of the Edict
            of Nantes in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1685. He was
            pleased indeed, and praised the deed, and celebrated it by a
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Te
            Deum</span></span>, but objected to the violent measures for the
            conversion of Protestants as contrary to the teaching of Christ.
            Then also there arose a keen struggle against the mischievous
            extension of the right of asylum on the part of foreign embassies
            at Rome. On the pope's representation all the powers but France
            agreed to a restriction of the custom. The pope tolerated the
            nuisance till the death of the French ambassador in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1687, but then
            insisted on its abolition under pain of the ban. In consequence
            of this Louis sent his new ambassador into Rome with two
            companies of cavaliers, threw the papal nuntio in France into
            prison, and laid siege to the papal state of Avignon (§ 110, 4).
            But Innocent was not thus to be terrorized, and the French
            ambassador was obliged, after eighteen months' vain
            demonstrations, to quit Rome. Alexander VIII. repeated the
            condemnation of the Four Propositions, and Innocent XIII. also
            stood firm. The French episcopate, on the pope's persistent
            refusal to install bishops <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page023">[pg 023]</span><a name="Pg023" id="Pg023" class=

            constrained to submit. <span class="tei tei-q">“Lying at the feet
            of his holiness,”</span> the bishops declared that everything
            concluded in that assembly was null and void; and even Louis
            XIV., under the influence of Madame de Maintenon (<a href=

            champion of the Copernican system. On this account he was charged
            by the monks with contradicting Scripture. In <span class=

            through Cardinal Bellarmine, threatened him with the Inquisition
            and prison unless he agreed to cease from vindicating and
            lecturing upon his heretical doctrine. He gave the required
            promise. But in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1632 he published a
            dialogue, in which three friends discussed the Ptolemaic and
            Copernican systems, without any formal conclusion, but giving
            overwhelming reasons in favour of the latter. Urban VIII., in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1636, called upon
            the Inquisition to institute a process against him. He was forced
            to recant, was condemned to prison for an indefinite period, but
            was soon liberated through powerful influence. How far the old
            man of seventy-two years of age was compelled by torture to
            retract is still a matter of controversy. It is, however, quite
            evident that it was forced from him by threats. But that Galileo

            his feet, muttering, <span class="tei tei-q">“Nevertheless it
            moves!”</span> is a legend of a romancing age. This, however, is
            the fact, that the Congregation of the Index declared the
            Copernican theory to be false, irrational, and directly contrary
            to Scripture; and that even in <span class=

            his death the idea was taken up by the whole Jesuit order. Their
            efforts, however, for fully a century proved unavailing. At this
            point, too, their most bitter opponents were the Dominicans. But
            even without papal authority the Jesuits so far succeeded in
            introducing the absurdities of this cult, and giving expression
            to it in word and by images, that by the beginning of the
            eighteenth century there were more than 300 male and female

            mostly in the direction of moral discipline and asceticism; but
            in the new congregation scholarship was represented by Calmet,
            Ceillier, etc., and many gave themselves to work as teachers in

            was conquered by the help of Dutch cannon; 37,000 were massacred
            in the fort, and the rest were hurled down from high rocks. The

            work, however, was still retained down to the nineteenth century.
            For when French missionaries went in <span class=

            they found to their surprise in the villages around thousands (?)
            who greeted them joyfully as the successors of the first
            Christian missionaries.</p>

            150, 1), the success of the mission continued uninterrupted. In
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1628 a German
            Jesuit, Adam Schell, went out from Cologne, who gained great fame
            at court for his mathematical skill. Louis XIV. founded at Paris
            a missionary college, which sent out Jesuits thoroughly trained
            in mathematics. But Dominicans and Franciscans over and over
            again complained to Rome of the Jesuits. They never allowed
            missionaries of other orders to come near their own
            establishments, and actually drove them away from places where
            they had begun to work. They even opposed priests, bishops, and
            vicars-apostolic sent by the Propaganda, declared their papal
            briefs forgeries, forbad their congregations to have any
            intercourse with those <span class="tei tei-q">“heretics,”</span>
            and under suspicion of Jansenism brought them before the
            Inquisition of Goa. Clement X. issued a firm-toned bull against
            such proceedings; but the Jesuits gave no heed to it, and
            attended only to their own general. The papal condemnation a
            century later of the Jesuits' accommodation scheme, and their
            permission of heathen rites and beliefs to the new converts,
            complained against by the Dominicans, was equally fruitless. In
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1645 Innocent X.
            forbad this practice on pain of excommunication; but still they
            continued it till the decree was modified by Alexander VII. in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1656. After
            persistent complaints by the Dominicans, Innocent XII. appointed
            a new congregation in Rome to investigate the question, but their
            deliberations yielded no result for ten years. At last Clement
            XI. confirmed the first decree of Innocent X., condemned anew the
            so called Chinese rites, and sent the legate Thomas of Tournon in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            consideration, fell into disfavour through Jesuit intrigues, was
            banished from the capital, and returned to Nankin. But as he
            continued his efforts from this point, and an attempt to poison
            him failed in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1707, he went to
            Macao, where he was put in prison by the Portuguese, in which he
            died in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1710. Clement XI.,
            in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1715, issued his
            decree against the Chinese rites in a yet severer form; but the
            Franciscan who proclaimed the papal bull was put in prison as an
            offender against the laws of the country, and, after being
            maltreated for seventeen months, was banished. So proudly
            confident had the Jesuits become, that in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1720 they treated
            with scorn and contempt the papal legate Mezzabarba, Patriarch of
            Alexandria, who tried by certain concessions to move them to
            submit. A more severe decree of Clement XII. of <span class=

            down their opposition, after the charges had been renewed by the
            Capuchin Norbert. All the Jesuit missionaries were now obliged by
            oath to exclude all pagan customs and rites; but with this all

            Jesuits.</span></em>—As Christian missions generally deserve
            credit, not only for introducing civilization and culture along
            with the preaching of the gospel into far distant heathen lands,
            but also for having greatly promoted the knowledge of countries,
            peoples, and languages among their fellow countrymen at home,
            opening up new fields for colonization and trade, these ends were
            also served by the world-wide missionary enterprises of the
            Jesuits, and were in perfect accordance with the character and
            intention of this order, which aimed at universal dominion. In
            carrying out these schemes the Jesuits abandoned the ascetical
            principles of their founder and their vow of poverty, amassing
            enormous wealth by securing in many parts a practical monopoly of
            trade. Their fifth general, Aquaviva (§ 149, 8), secured from
            Gregory XIII., avowedly in favour of the mission, exclusive right
            to trade with both Indies. They soon erected great factories in
            all parts of the world, and had ships laden with valuable
            merchandise on all seas. They had mines, farms, sugar
            plantations, apothecary shops, bakeries, etc., founded banks,
            sold relics, miracle-working amulets, rosaries, healing Ignatius-
            and Xavier-water (§ 149, 11), etc., and in successful
            legacy-hunting excelled all other orders. Urban VIII. and Clement
            XI. issued severe bulls against such abuses, but only succeeded
            in restricting them to some extent.—Continuation, <a href=

            on his recantation, and the second, seven years after, upon his
            submitting to a severe flagellation. In spite of all he held to

            recognised as thoroughly orthodox. But now the Jesuits appeared
            as the determined opponents of all mysticism that savoured of
            enthusiasm. By means of vile intrigues they succeeded in getting
            Molinos, Guyon, and Fénelon condemned, as <span class=

            their party had been canonized and his doctrine solemnly
            sanctioned by the pope. Yet more objectionable to the Jesuits was
            that reaction toward Augustinianism which, hitherto limited to
            the Dominicans (§ 149, 13), and treated by them as a theological
            theory, was now spreading among other orders in the form of
            French Jansenism, accompanied by deep moral earnestness and a
            revival of the whole Christian life.</p>

            de Sales a great multitude of male and female apostles of the new
            mystical gospel sprang up, and were favourably received by all
            the more moderate church leaders. The reactionaries, headed by
            the Jesuits, sought therefore all the more eagerly to deal
            severely with the Spaniard Michael Molinos. Having settled in
            Rome in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1669, he soon
            became the most popular of father confessors. His <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Spiritual Guide”</span> in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1675 received the
            approval of the Holy Office, and was introduced into Protestant
            Germany through a Latin translation by Francke in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1687, and a German
            translation in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1699 by Arnold. In
            it he taught those who came to the confessional that the way to
            the perfection of the Christian life, which consists in peaceful
            rest in the most intimate communion with God, is to be found in
            spiritual conference, secret prayer, active and passive
            contemplation, in rigorous destruction of all self-will, and in
            disinterested love of God, fortified, wherever that is possible,
            by daily communion. The success of the book was astonishing. It
            promptly influenced all ranks and classes, both men and women,
            lay and clerical, not only in Italy, but also by means of
            translations in France and Spain. But soon a reaction set in. As
            early as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1681 the famous
            Jesuit <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Segneri</span></em> issued a treatise, in
            which he charged Molinos' contemplative mysticism with
            onesidedness and exaggeration. He was answered by the pious and
            learned Oratorian <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Petrucci</span></em>. A commission,
            appointed by the Inquisition to examine the writings of both
            parties, pronounced the views of Molinos and Petrucci to be in
            accordance with church doctrine and Segneri's objections to be
            unfounded. All that Jesuitism reckoned as foundation, means, and
            end of piety was characterized as purely elementary. No hope
            could be entertained of winning over Innocent XI., the bitter
            enemy of the Jesuits. But Louis XIV. of France, at the
            instigation of his Jesuit father confessor, Lachaise, expressed
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page032">[pg 032]</span><a name=
            "Pg032" id="Pg032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> through his
            ambassador his surprise that his holiness should, not only
            tolerate, but even encourage and support so dangerous a heretic,
            who taught all Christendom to undervalue the public services of
            the Church. In <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1685 Innocent
            referred the matter to the tribunal of the Inquisition.
            Throughout the two years during which the investigation proceeded
            all arts were used to secure condemnation. Extreme statements of
            fanatical adherents of Molinos were not rarely met with,
            depreciating the public ordinances and ceremonies, confession,
            hearing of mass, church prayers, rosaries, etc. The pope, facile
            with age, amid groans and lamentations, allowed things to take
            their course, and at last confirmed the decree of the Inquisition
            of August 28th, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            from the utterances of his adherents, were condemned as heretical
            and blasphemous. The heretic was to abjure his heresies publicly,
            clad in penitential garments, and was then consigned to lifelong
            solitary confinement in a Dominican cloister, where he died in

            her husband's death, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Madame Guyon</span></em>, in company with
            her father confessor, the Barnabite <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Lacombe</span></em>, who had been initiated
            during a long residence at Rome into the mysteries of Molinist
            mysticism, spent five years travelling through France,
            Switzerland, Savoy, and Piedmont. Though already much suspected,
            she won the hearts of many men and women among the clergy and
            laity, and enkindled in them by personal conference,
            correspondence, and her literary work, the ardour of mystical
            love. Her brilliant writings are indeed disfigured by traces of
            foolish exaggeration, fanaticism and spiritual pride. She calls
            herself the woman of Revelation xii. 1, and the <span class=
            "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">mère de la
            grace</span></span> of her adherents. The following are the main
            distinguishing characteristics of her mysticism: The necessity of
            turning away from everything creaturely, rejecting all earthly
            pleasure and destroying every selfish interest, as well as of
            turning to God in passive contemplation, silent devotion, naked
            faith, which dispensed with all intellectual evidence, and pure
            disinterested love, which loves God for Himself alone, not for
            the eternal salvation obtained through Him. On her return to
            Paris with Lacombe in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1686 the proper
            martyrdom of her life began. Her chief persecutor was her
            step-brother, the Parisian superior of the Barnabites, La Mothe,
            who spread the most scandalous reports about his half-sister and
            Lacombe, and had them both imprisoned by a royal decree in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1688. Lacombe never
            regained his liberty. Taken from one prison to another, he lost
            his reason, and died in an asylum in <span class=

            by the influence of Madame de Maintenon, was released after ten
            months' confinement. The favour of this royal dame was not of
            long continuance. Warned on all sides of the dangerous heretic,
            she broke off all intercourse with her in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1693, and persuaded
            the king to appoint a new commission, in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1694, with Bishop
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Bossuet</span></em> of Meaux at its head, to
            examine her suspected writings. This commission meeting at Issy,
            had already, in February, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1695, drawn up
            thirty test articles, when <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Fénelon</span></em>, tutor of the king's
            grandson, and now nominated to the archbishopric of Cambray, was
            ordered by the king to take part in the proceedings. He signed
            the articles, though he objected to much in them, and had four
            articles of his own added. Madame Guyon also did so, and Bossuet
            at last testified for her that he had found her moral character
            stainless and her doctrine free from Molinist heresy. But the
            bigot Maintenon was not satisfied with this. Bossuet demanded the
            surrender of this certificate that he might draw up another; and
            when Madame Guyon refused, on the basis of a statement by the
            crazed Lacombe, she was sent to the Bastile in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=

            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1697 Fénelon had
            written in her defence his <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang=

            "font-style: italic">Explication des Maximes des Saintes sur la
            Vie Intérieur</span></span>,”</span> showing that the condemned
            doctrines of passive contemplation, secret prayer, naked faith,
            and disinterested love, had all been previously taught by St.
            Theresa, John of the Cross, Francis de Sales, and other saints.
            He sent this treatise for an opinion to Rome. A violent
            controversy then arose between Bossuet and Fénelon. The pious,
            well-meaning pope, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Innocent XII.</span></em>, endeavoured
            vainly to bring about a good understanding. Bossuet and the
            all-powerful Maintenon wished no reconciliation, but
            condemnation, and gave the king and pope no rest till very
            reluctantly he prohibited the objectionable book by a brief in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1699, and condemned
            twenty-three propositions from it as heretical. Fénelon, strongly
            attached to the church, and a bitter persecutor of Protestants,
            made an unconditional surrender, as guilty of a defective
            exposition of the truth. But Madame Guyon continued in the
            Bastile till <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1701, when she

            died in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1715. She published

            around her a party of believers in her theosophic and fantastic
            revelations. She was obliged to flee to the Netherlands, and
            there, by the force of her eloquence in speech and writing,
            spread her views among the Protestants. Among them she attracted
            the great scientist Swammerdam. But when she introduced politics,
            she escaped imprisonment only by flight. Down to her death in

            Augustine's numerous followers in France felt themselves hit by

            Hauranne, usually called St. Cyran, from the Benedictine
            monastery of which he was abbot, was the bitter foe of the
            Jesuits and Richelieu, who had him cast into prison in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            Antoine Arnauld, doctor of the Sorbonne, who died in <span class=

            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1694, the youngest
            of twenty children of a parliamentary advocate, whose powerful
            defence of the University of Paris against the Jesuits called
            forth their hatred and lifelong persecution. His mantle, as a
            vigorous polemist, had fallen upon his youngest son. Very
            important too was the influence of his much older sister,
            Angelica Arnauld, Abbess of the Cistercian cloister of Port Royal
            des Champs, six miles from Paris, which under her became the
            centre of religious life and effort for all <span class=

            some of the noblest, most pious, and talented men of the time:
            the poet Racine, the mathematician and apologist Pascal, the
            Bible translator De Sacy, the church historian Tillemont, all
            ardent admirers of Augustine and determined opponents of the lax
            morality of the Jesuits. Arnauld's book, <span class=

            the Parliament, and the most distinguished of the French clergy;
            but in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1653 Innocent X.
            condemned five Jansenist propositions in it as heretical. The
            Augustinians now maintained that these doctrines were not taught
            in the sense attributed to them by the pope. Arnauld
            distinguished the <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign"
            xml:lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">question du

            that the latter only were subject to the judgment of the Holy
            See. The Sorbonne, now greatly changed in composition and
            character, expelled him on account of this position from its
            corporation in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1656. About this
            time, at Arnauld's instigation, Pascal, the profound and
            brilliant author of <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="fr"
            class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style=

            Montalte to publish his famous <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Provincial Letters,”</span> which in an admirable
            style exposed and lashed with deep earnestness and biting wit the
            base moral principles of Jesuit casuistry. The truly annihilating
            effect of these letters upon the reputation of the powerful order
            could not be checked by their being burnt by order of Parliament
            by the hangman at Aix in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1657, and at Paris
            in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1660. But meanwhile
            the specifically Jansenist movement entered upon a new phase of
            its development. Alexander VII. had issued in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1656 a bull which
            denounced the application of the distinction <span lang="fr"
            class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">du fait</span></span> and <span lang="fr"
            class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">du droit</span></span> to the papal decrees
            as derogatory to the holy see, and affirmed that Jansen taught
            the five propositions in the sense they had been condemned. In
            order to enforce the sentence, Annal, the Jesuit father confessor
            of Louis XIV., obtained in 1661 a royal decree requiring all
            French clergy, monks, nuns, and teachers to sign a formula
            unconditionally accepting this bull. Those who refused were
            banished, and fled mostly to the Netherlands. The sorely
            oppressed nuns of Port Royal at last reluctantly agreed to sign
            it; but they were still persecuted, and in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1664 the new
            archbishop, Perefixe, inaugurated a more severe persecution,
            placed this cloister under the interdict, and removed some of the
            nuns to other convents. In <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1669, Alexander's
            successor, Clement IX., secured the submission of Arnauld, De
            Sacy, Nicole, and many of the nuns by a policy of mild
            connivance. But the hatred of the Jesuits was still directed
            against their cloister. In <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1705 Clement XI.
            again demanded full and unconditioned acceptance of the decree of
            Alexander VII., and when the nuns refused, the pope, in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1708, declared this
            convent an irredeemable nest of heresy, and ordered its
            suppression, which was carried out in <span class=

            theology flourished during the seventeenth century as it had
            never done since the twelfth and thirteenth. Especially in the
            liberal Gallican church there was a vigorous scientific life. The
            Parisian Sorbonne and the orders of the Jesuits, St. Maur, and
            the Oratorians, excelled in theological, particularly in
            patristic and historical, learning, and the contemporary
            brilliancy of Reformed theology in France afforded a powerful
            stimulus. But the best days of art, especially Italian painting,
            were now past. Sacred music was diligently cultivated, though in
            a secularized style, and many gifted hymn-writers made their
            appearance in Spain and Germany.</p>

            "font-style: italic">Friedr. von Spee</span></em>, died
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1635. His spiritual
            songs show deep love to the Saviour and a profound feeling for
            nature, approaching in some respects the style of the evangelical
            hymn-writers. Spee was a keen but unsuccessful opponent of witch
            prosecution. Another eminent poetic genius of the age was the
            Jesuit <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Jac. Balde</span></em> of Munich, who died
            in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1688. He is at his
            best in lyrical poetry. A deep religious vein runs through all
            his Latin odes, in which he enthusiastically appeals to the
            Virgin to raise him above all earthly passions. To Herder belongs
            the merit of rescuing him from oblivion.</p>

            Lutherans, and secured a hundred years' supremacy of orthodoxy,
            notwithstanding two Christological controversies. Gradually,
            however, a new dogmatic scholasticism arose, which had the
            defects as well as the excellences of the mediæval system. The
            orthodoxy of this school deteriorated, on the one hand, into
            violent polemic on confessional differences, and, on the other,
            into undue depreciation of outward forms in favour of a spiritual
            life and personal piety. These tendencies are represented by the
            Syncretist and Pietist controversies.</p>

            death was of far less importance. Lütkemann, a professor of
            philosophy at Rostock, affirmed that in death, because the unity
            of soul and body was broken, Christ was not true man, and that to
            deny this was to destroy the reality and the saving power of his
            death. He held that the incarnation of Christ lasted through
            death, because the divine nature was connected, not only with the
            soul, but also with the body. Lütkemann was obliged to quit
            Rostock, but got an honourable call to Brunswick as
            superintendent and court preacher, and there died in <span class=

            tendency, and gave even greater freedom in the treatment of
            doctrines than the Formula of Concord, which it declined to

            1614 for forty years he laboured in promoting its interests. He
            was a man of wide culture and experience, who had obtained a
            thorough knowledge of church history, and acquaintance with the
            most distinguished theologians of all churches, during his
            extensive foreign travels, and therewith a geniality and breadth
            of view not by any means common in those days. He did not indeed
            desire any formal union between the different churches, but
            rather a mutual recognition, love, and tolerance. For this
            purpose he set, as a secondary principle of Christian theology,
            besides Scripture, as the primary principle, the consensus of the
            first five centuries as the common basis of all churches, and
            sought to represent later ecclesiastical differences as
            unessential or of less consequence. This was denounced by strict
            Lutherans as Syncretism and Cryptocatholicism. In <span class=

            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1639 the Hanoverian

            controversy arose, which divided Lutherans into two camps. On the
            one side were the universities of Helmstadt and Königsberg; on
            the other hand, the theologians of the electorate of <span class=

            twenty-six controversial treatises on this subject. Jena vainly
            sought to mediate between the parties. In the <span lang="la"

            Wittenberg divines failed to secure symbolical authority, the
            following sentiments were branded as Syncretist errors: That in
            the Apostles' Creed everything is taught that is necessary to
            salvation; that the Catholic and Reformed systems retain hold of
            fundamental truths; that original sin is of a merely privative
            nature; that God <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"

            that the doctrine of the Trinity was first clearly revealed in
            the New Testament, etc. Calixt died <span class=

            of most violent controversies. His son Ulrich continued these,
            but had neither the ability nor moderation of his father. Even
            the peaceably disposed Conference of Cassel of <span class=

            poured oil on the flames. The strife lost itself at last in
            actions for damages between the younger Calixt and his bitter
            opponent Strauch of Wittenberg. Wearied of these fruitless
            discussions, theologians now turned their attention to the rising

            gifts, and singularly wide scholarship, made president of a
            clerical seminary at Frankfort-on-Main. In <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1686 he became
            chief court preacher at Dresden, and provost of Berlin in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1691, when, on
            account of his intense earnestness in pastoral work, he had been
            expelled from Dresden. He died in Berlin in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1705. His year's
            attendance at Geneva after the completion of his curriculum at
            Strassburg had an important influence on his whole future career.
            He there learned to value discipline for securing purity of life
            as well as of doctrine, and was also powerfully impressed by the
            practical lectures of Labadie (<a href="#Section_163_Para_7"
            class="tei tei-ref">§ 163, 7</a>) and the reading of the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Practice of Piety”</span> and other
            ascetical writings of the English Puritans (<a href=
            "#Section_162_Para_3" class="tei tei-ref">§ 162, 3</a>). Though
            strongly attached to the Lutheran church, he believed that in the
            restoration of evangelical doctrine by the Wittenberg
            Reformation, <span class="tei tei-q">“not by any means had all
            been accomplished that needed to be done,”</span> and that
            Lutheranism in the form of the orthodoxy of the age had lost the
            living power of the reformers, and was in danger of burying its
            talent in dead and barren service of the letter. There was
            therefore a pressing need of a new and wider reformation. In the
            Lutheran church, as the depository of sound doctrine, he
            recognised the fittest field for the development of a
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page042">[pg 042]</span><a name=
            "Pg042" id="Pg042" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> genuinely
            Christian life; but he heartily appreciated any true spiritual
            movement in whatsoever church it arose. He went back from
            scholastic dogmatics to Holy Scripture as the living source of
            saving knowledge, substituted for the external orthodox theology
            the theology of the heart, demanded evidence of this in a pious
            Christian walk: these were the means by which he sought to
            promote his reformation. A whole series of Lutheran theologians
            of the seventeenth century (<a href="#Section_159" class=
            "tei tei-ref">§ 159</a>) had indeed contributed to this same end
            by their devotional works, hymns, and sermons. What was new in
            Spener was the conviction of the insufficiency of the hitherto
            used means and the undue prominence given to doctrine, and his
            consequent effort vigorously made to raise the tone of the
            Christian life. In his childlike, pious humility he regarded
            himself as by no means called to carry out this work, but felt it
            his duty to insist upon the necessity of it, and indicate the
            means that should be used to realize it. This he did in his work
            of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1675, <span class=

            "la"><span style="font-style: italic">Pia
            Desideria</span></span>.”</span> As it was his aim to recommend
            biblical practical Christianity to the heart of the individual
            Christian, he revived the almost forgotten doctrine <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Of Spiritual Priesthood”</span> in a separate
            treatise. In <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1670 he began to
            have meetings in his own house for encouraging Christian piety in
            the community, which soon were imitated in other places. Spener's
            influence on the Lutheran church became greater and wider through
            his position at Dresden. Stirred up by his spirit, three young
            graduates of Leipzig. A. H. Francke, Paul Anton, and J. K.
            Schade, formed in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1686 a private
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Collegia Philobiblica</span></span> for
            practical exposition of Scripture and the delivery of public
            exegetical lectures at the university in the German language. But
            the Leipzig theological faculty, with J. B. Carpzov II. at its
            head, charged them with despising the public ordinances as well
            as theological science, and with favouring the views of
            separatists. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Collegia Philobiblica</span></span> was
            suppressed, and the three friends obliged to leave Leipzig in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1690. This marked
            the beginning of the Pietist controversies. Soon afterwards
            Spener was expelled from Dresden; but in his new position at
            Berlin he secured great influence in the appointments to the
            theological faculty of the new university founded at Halle by the
            peace-loving elector Frederick III. of Brandenburg, in opposition
            to the contentious universities of Wittenberg and Leipzig.
            Francke, Anton, and Breithaupt were made professors of theology.
            Halle now won the position which Wittenberg and Geneva had held
            during the Reformation period, and the Pietist controversy thus
            entered upon a second, more general, and more critical epoch of
            its history.<a id="noteref_24" name="noteref_24" href=

            of the century, a lively controversy was carried on about the
            Greek style of the New Testament, in which Lutherans, and
            especially the Reformed, took part. The purists maintained that
            the New Testament idiom was pure and classical, thinking that its
            inspiration would otherwise be endangered. The first

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The attachment
            of the Lutheran church of this age to pure doctrine led to a
            one-sided over-estimation of it, often ending in dead orthodoxy.
            But a succession of able and learned theologians, who recognised
            the importance of heart theology as well as sound doctrine,
            corrected this evil tendency by Scripture study, preaching, and
            faithful pastoral work. A noble and moderate mysticism, which was
            thoroughly orthodox in its beliefs, and opposing orthodoxy only
            where that had become external and mechanical, had many
            influential representatives throughout the whole country,
            especially during the first half of it. But also separatists,
            mystics, and theosophists made their appearance, who were
            decidedly hostile to the church. Sacred song flourished afresh
            amid the troubles of the Thirty Years' War; but gradually lost
            its sublime objective church character, which was poorly
            compensated by a more flowing versification, polished language,
            and elegant form. A corresponding advance was also made in church
            music.</p>

            brought the controversy to a close.—The Württemberg theologian,

            mystico-theosophical tendency, partly in outward connexion with
            the church, partly without and in open opposition to it, was
            fostered by the alchemist writings of Agrippa and Paracelsus, the
            theosophical works of Weigel (§ 146, 2) and by the profound
            revelations of the inspired shoemaker of Görlitz, <em class=

            theosophists. In a remarkable degree he combined a genius for
            speculation with the most unfeigned piety that held firmly by the
            old Lutheran faith. Even when an itinerant tradesman, he felt
            himself for a period of seven days in calm repose, surrounded by
            the divine light. But he dates his profound theosophical
            enlightenment from a moment in <span class=

            young journeyman and married, thrown into an ecstasy, he obtained
            a knowledge of the divine mysteries down to the ultimate
            principles of all things and their inmost quality. His theosophy,
            too, like that of the ancient gnostics, springs out of the
            question about the origin of evil. He solves it by assuming

            qualities, are thoroughly tempered and perfectly combined, while

            disharmony, but are reconciled and reduced to godlike harmony

            differing from them all, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            orthodoxy and canonized the heretics of all ages. In <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1700 he wrote
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The Mystery of the Divine
            Sophia.”</span> When Adam, originally man and woman, fell, his
            female nature, the heavenly Sophia, was taken from him, and in
            his place a woman of flesh was made for him out of a rib; in
            order again to restore the paradisiacal perfection Christ brought
            again the male part into a virgin's womb, so that the new
            creature, the regenerate, stands before God as a <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“male-virgin”</span>; but carnal love destroys again
            the connexion thus secured with the heavenly Sophia. But the very
            next year he reached a turning-point in his life. He not only
            married, but in consequence accepted several appointments in the
            Lutheran church, without, however, signing the Formula of
            Concord, and applied his literary skill to the production of
            devotional tracts.</p>

            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1618-1648. The
            Psalms of David were the model and pattern of the sacred poets,
            and the profoundest songs of the cross and consolation bear the
            evident impress of the times, and so individual feeling comes
            more into prominence. The influence of Opitz was also felt in the
            church song, in the greater attention given to correctness and
            purity of language and to the careful construction of verse and
            rhyme. Instead of the rugged terseness and vigour of earlier
            days, we now find often diffuse and overflowing utterances of the
            heart. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            century sacred song became more subjective, and so tended to fall
            into a diversity of groups. No longer does the church sing
            through its poets, but the poets give direct expression to their
            individual feelings. Confessional songs are less frequent, and
            their place is taken by hymns of edification with reference to
            various conditions of life; songs of death, the cross and
            consolation, and hymns for the family become more numerous. With
            objectivity special features of the church song disappear in the
            hymns of the period; but some of its essential characteristics
            remain, especially the popular form and contents, the freshness,
            liveliness, and simplicity of diction, the truths of personal
            experience, the fulness of faith, etc. We distinguish three
            groups: (1) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">The Transition Group</span></em>, passing
            from objectivity to subjectivity. Its greatest masters, indeed
            after Luther the greatest sacred poet of the evangelical church,
            is undoubtedly <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Paul Gerhardt</span></em>, who died
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            witness of the Lutheran faith under the wars and in persecution
            (<a href="#Section_154_Para_4" class="tei tei-ref">§ 154, 4</a>).
            In him we find the new subjective tendency in its noblest form;
            but there is also present the old objective style, giving
            immediate expression to the consciousness of the church, adhering
            tenaciously to the confession, and a grand popular ring that
            reminds us of the fulness and power of Luther. His 131 songs, if
            not all church songs in the narrower sense, are almost all
            genuine poems: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            took the Canticles instead of the Psalter as its model. The
            spiritual marriage of the soul is its main theme. Feeling and
            fancy are predominant, and often degenerate into sentimentality
            and trifling. It obtained a new impulse from the addition of a

            church music in the beginning of the seventeenth century was
            affected by the Italian school, just as church song was by the
            influence of Opitz. The greatest master during the transition
            stage was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            chorale what Gerhardt was to the church song. We have seventy-one
            new melodies of his, admirably adapted to Gerhardt's, Hunnius's,
            Franck's, Dach's, and Rinkart's songs, and used in the church
            till the present time. With the second half of the century we
            enter on a new period, in which expression and musical
            declamation perish. Choir singing now, to a great extent,
            supersedes congregational singing. <em class=

            controversies that prevailed during the terrible upheaval of the
            Thirty Years' War. The abundance of devotional literature of

            church, missionary enterprise had rather fallen behind (§ 142,
            8). Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden carried on the Lapp mission with
            new zeal, and Denmark, too, gave ready assistance. A Norwegian
            pastor, Thomas Westen, deserves special mention as the apostle of
            the mission. A German, Peter Heyling of Lübeck, went on his own
            account as a missionary to Abyssinia in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1635, while several
            of his friends at the same time went to other eastern lands. Of
            these others no trace whatever has been found. An Abyssinian
            abbot who came to Europe brought news of Heyling. At first he was
            hindered by the machinations of the Jesuits; but when these were
            expelled, he found favour at court, became minister to the king,
            and married one of the royal family. What finally came of him and
            his work is unknown. Toward the end of the century two great men,
            the philosopher Leibnitz and the founder of the Halle Orphanage,
            A. H. Francke, warmly espoused the cause of foreign missions. The
            ambitious and pretentious schemes of the philosopher ended in
            nothing, but Francke made his orphanages, training colleges and
            centres from which the German Lutheran missions to the heathens
            were vigorously organized and successfully wrought.—Continuation,

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Reformed
            scholars of France vied with those of St. Maur and the Oratory,
            and the Reformed theologians of the Netherlands, England, and
            Switzerland were not a whit behind. But an attempt made at a
            general synod at Dort to unite all the Reformed national churches
            under one confession failed. Opposition to Calvin's extreme
            theory of predestination introduced a Pelagianizing current into
            the Reformed church, which was by no means confined to professed
            Arminians. In the Anglican church this tendency appeared in the
            forms of latitudinarianism and deism (<a href=
            "#Section_164_Para_3" class="tei tei-ref">§ 164, 3</a>); while in
            France it took a more moderate course, and approximated rather to
            the Lutheran doctrine. It was a reaction of latent Zwinglianism
            against the dominant Calvinism. The Voetian school successfully
            opposed the introduction <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            supremacy to a scholasticism which held its own alongside of that
            of the Lutherans. In opposition to it, the Cocceian federal
            school undertook to produce a purely biblical system of theology
            in all its departments.</p>

            Netherlands had already a strictly Calvinistic symbol, but
            Calvinism had not thoroughly permeated the church doctrine and
            constitution. There were more opponents than supporters of the
            doctrine of predestination, and a Melanchthonian-synergistic (§
            141, 7), or even an Erasmian-semipelagian, (§ 125, 3) doctrine,
            of the freedom of the will and the efficacy of grace, was more
            frequently taught and preached than the Augustinian-Calvinistic
            doctrine. So also Zwingli's view of the relation of church and
            state was in much greater favour than the Calvinistic
            Presbyterial church government with its terrorist discipline. But
            the return of the exiles in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1572, who had
            adopted strict Calvinistic views in East Friesland and on the
            Lower German Rhine, led to the adoption of a purely Calvinistic
            creed and constitution. The keenest opponent of this movement was
            Coornhert, notary and secretary for the city of Haarlem, who
            combated Calvinism in numerous writings, and depreciated doctrine
            generally in the interests of practical living Christianity.
            Political as well as religious sympathies were enlisted in favour
            of this freer ecclesiastical tendency. The Dutch War of
            Independence was a struggle for religious freedom against Spanish
            Catholic fanaticism. The young republic therefore became the
            first home of religious toleration, which was scarcely
            reconcilable with a strict and exclusive Calvinism.—Meanwhile
            within the Calvinistic church a controversy arose, which divided
            its adherents in the Netherlands into two parties. In opposition
            to the strict Calvinists, who as supralapsarians held that the
            fall itself was included in the eternal counsels of God, there
            arose the milder infralapsarians, who made predestination come in
            after the fall, which was not predestinated but only foreseen by
            God.</p>

            Arminius (born <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1560), a pupil of
            Beza, but a declared adherent of the Ramist philosophy (§ 143,
            6), was appointed pastor in Amsterdam, and ordered by the
            magistrates to controvert Coornhert's universalism and the
            infralapsarianism of the ministers of Delft. He therefore studied
            Coornhert's writings, and by them was shaken in his earlier
            beliefs. This was shown first in certain sermons on passages from
            Romans, which made him suspected of Pelagianism. In <span class=

            theological professor of Leyden, where he found a bitter opponent
            in his supralapsarian colleague, Francis Gomarus. From the
            class-rooms the controversy spread to the pulpits, and even into
            domestic circles. A public disputation in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1608, led to no
            pacific result, and Arminius continued involved in controversies
            till his death in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1609. Although
            decidedly inclined toward universalism, he had directed his
            polemic mainly against supralapsarianism, as making God himself
            the author of sin. But his followers went beyond these limits.
            When denounced by the Gomarists as Pelagians, they addressed to
            the provincial parliament of Holland and West Friesland, in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1610, a
            remonstrance, which in five articles repudiates supralapsarianism
            and infralapsarianism, and the doctrines of the irresistibility
            of grace, and of the impossibility of the elect finally falling
            away from it, and boldly asserts the universality of grace. They
            were hence called Remonstrants and their opponents
            Contraremonstrants. Parliament, favourably inclined toward the
            Arminians, pronounced the difference non-fundamental, and
            enjoined peace. When Vorstius, who was practically a Socinian,
            was appointed successor to Arminius, Gomarus charged the
            Remonstrants with Socinianism. Their ablest theological
            representative was Simon Episcopius, who succeeded Gomarus at
            Leyden in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1612, supported by
            the distinguished statesman, Oldenbarneveldt, and the great
            jurist, humanist, and theologian, Hugo Grotius of Rotterdam.
            Maurice of Orange, too, for a long time sided with them, but in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1617 formally went
            over to the other party, whose well-knit unity, strict
            discipline, and rigorous energy commended them to him as the
            fittest associates in his struggle for absolute monarchy. The
            republican-Arminian party was conquered, Oldenbarneveldt being
            executed in 1619, Grotius escaping by his wife's strategem.
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">The

            twenty-eight theologians from England, Scotland, Germany, and
            Switzerland. Brandenburg took no part in it (<a href=

            French theologians were refused permission to go. Episcopius
            presented a clear and comprehensive apology for the Remonstrants,
            and bravely defended their cause before the synod. Refusing to
            submit to the decisions of the synod, they were at the
            fifty-seventh session expelled, and then excommunicated and
            deprived of all ecclesiastical offices. The Heidelberg Catechism
            and the Belgic Confession were unanimously adopted as the creed
            and manual of orthodox teaching. In the discussion of the five
            controverted points, the opposition of the Anglican and German
            delegates prevented any open and manifest insertion of
            supralapsarian theses, so that the synodal canons set forth only

            number of congregations, however, remained small, and their
            importance in church history consists rather in the development
            of an independent church life than in the revival of a

            Brandenburg, Hesse, and Bremen, where a moderate Calvinism
            continued to prevail. In England and Scotland the Presbyterians
            enthusiastically approved of the decrees, whereas the
            Episcopalians repudiated them, and, rushing to the other extreme
            of latitudinarianism, often showed lukewarm indifferentism in the
            way in which they distinguished articles of faith as essential
            and non-essential. The worthiest of the latitudinarians of this
            age was Chillingworth, who sought an escape from the contentions
            of theologians in the Catholic church, but soon returned to
            Protestantism, seeking and finding peace in God's word alone.

            further, repudiating the unconditional imputation of Adam's sin,
            and representing original sin simply as an evil which becomes
            guilt only as our own actual transgression. The synods just named

            bitter discussion about the universality of grace, by maintaining
            that in conversion divine providence wrought only through the
            circumstances of the life, and the Holy Spirit through the word
            of God. Several French synods condemned this doctrine, and
            affirmed an immediate as well as a mediate operation of the
            Spirit and providence.—Genuine Calvinism was best represented in
            Switzerland, as finally expressed in the <em class=

            doctrine rather than a confession. In opposition to Amyrault and
            De la Place, it set forth a strict theory of predestination and
            original sin, and maintained with the Buxtorfs, against Cappellus
            of Saumur, the inspiration of the Hebrew vowel points.</p>

            whole doctrine of saving truth from the point of view of a
            covenant of grace between God and man; and this idea was
            afterwards carried out by Olevianus of Heidelberg (§ 144, 1) in
            his <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class=

            of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            the favourite method of distribution of doctrine in the whole
            German Reformed church. In the Dutch church it was regarded as
            quite unobjectionable. In England it was adopted in the
            Westminster Confession of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1648 (<a href=
            "#Section_155_Para_1" class="tei tei-ref">§ 155, 1</a>), and in
            Switzerland in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1675, in the
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Formula
            Consensus</span></em>. Cocceius is therefore not the founder of
            the federal theology. He simply gave it a new and independent
            development, and freed it from the trammels of scholastic
            dogmatics. He distinguished a twofold covenant of God with man:
            the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "la"><span style="font-style: italic">fœdus operum s.
            naturæ</span></span> before, and the <span lang="la" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">fœdus gratiæ</span></span> after the fall.
            He then subdivided the covenant of grace into three economies:
            before the law until Moses; under the law until Christ; and after
            the law in the Christian church. The history of the kingdom of
            God in the Christian era was arranged in seven periods,
            corresponding to the seven apocalyptic epistles, trumpets, and
            seals. In his treatment of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page055">[pg 055]</span><a name="Pg055" id="Pg055" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> his theme, he repudiated philosophy,
            scholasticism, and tradition, and held simply by Scripture. He is
            thus the founder of a purely biblical theology. He attached
            himself as closely as possible to the prevailing
            predestinationist orthodoxy, but only externally. In his view the
            sacred history in its various epochs adjusted itself to the needs
            of human personality, and to the growing capacity for
            appropriating it. Hence it was not the idea of election, but that
            of grace, that prevailed in his system. Christ is the centre of
            all history, spiritual, ecclesiastical, and civil; and so
            everything in Scripture, history, doctrine, and prophecy,
            necessarily and immediately stands related to him. The O.T.
            prophecies and types point to the Christ that was to come in the
            flesh, and all history after Christ points to his second coming;
            and O. and N.T. give an outline of ecclesiastical and civil
            history down to the end of time. Thus typology formed the basis
            of the Cocceian theology. In exegesis, however, Cocceius avoided
            all arbitrary allegorizing. It was with him an axiom in
            hermeneutics, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "la"><span style="font-style: italic">Id significan verba, quod
            significare possunt in integra oratione, sic ut omnino inter se
            conveniant</span></span>. Yet his typology led him, and still
            more many of his adherents, into fantastic exegetical errors in
            the prophetic treatment of the seven apocalyptic periods.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><a name=
            "Section_161_Para_5" id="Section_161_Para_5" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> 5. A controversy, occasioned by Cocceius'
            statement, in his commentary on Hebrews in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1658, that the
            Sabbath, as enjoined by the O.T. ceremonial law, was no longer
            binding, was stopped in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1659 by a State
            prohibition. Voetius had not taken part in it. But when Cocceius,
            in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1665, taught from
            Romans iii. 25, that believers under the law had not full
            <span class="tei tei-q">“ἄφεσις,”</span> only a <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“πάρεσις,”</span> he felt obliged to enter the lists
            against this <span class="tei tei-q">“Socinian”</span> heresy.
            The controversy soon spread to other doctrines of Cocceius and
            his followers, and soon the whole populace seemed divided into
            Voetians and Cocceians (<a href="#Section_162_Para_5" class=
            "tei tei-ref">§ 162, 5</a>). The one hurled offensive epithets at
            the other. The Orange political party sought and obtained the
            favour of the Voetians, as before they had that of the Gomarists;
            while the liberal republican party coalesced with the Cocceians.
            Philosophical questions next came to be mixed up in the
            discussion. The philosophy of the French Catholic <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Descartes</span></em> (<a href=
            "#Section_164_Para_1" class="tei tei-ref">§ 164, 1</a>), settled
            in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1629 in Amsterdam,
            had gained ground in the Netherlands. It had indeed no connexion
            with Christianity or church, and its theological friends wished
            only to have it recognised as a formal branch of study. But its
            fundamental principle, that all true knowledge starts from doubt,
            appeared to the representatives of orthodoxy as threatening the
            church with serious danger. Even in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1643 Voetius
            opposed it, and mainly in consequence of his polemic, the States
            General, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1656, forbad it
            being taught in the universities. Their common opposition to
            scholasticism, however, brought Cocceians and Cartesians more
            closely to one <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page056">[pg
            056]</span><a name="Pg056" id="Pg056" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            another. Theology now became influenced by Cartesianism. Roëll,
            professor at Franeker and Utrecht, who died <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1718, taught that
            the divinity of the Scriptures must be proved to the reason,
            since the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "la"><span style="font-style: italic">testimonium Spir. s.
            internum</span></span> is limited to those who already believe,
            rejected the doctrine of the imputation of original sin, the
            doctrine that death is for believers the punishment of sin, and
            the application of the idea of eternal <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“generation”</span> to the Logos, to whom the
            predicate of sonship belongs only in regard to the decree of
            redemption and incarnation. Another zealous Cartesian, Balth.
            Bekker, not only repudiated the superstitions of the age about
            witchcraft (§ 117, 4), but also denied the existence of the devil
            and demons. The Cocceians were in no way responsible for such
            extravagances, but their opponents sought to make them chargeable
            for these. The stadtholder, William III., at last issued an
            order, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            Belgic Confession agreed indeed that these books should be read
            in church, and proof passages taken from them, in so far as they
            were in accord with the canonical Scriptures. The Anglican Book
            of Common Prayer gives readings from these books. On the other
            hand, although at the Synod of Dort the proposal to remove at
            least the apocryphal books of Ezra or Esdras, Tobit, Judith, Bel
            and the Dragon, was indeed rejected, it was ordered that in
            future all apocryphal books should be printed in smaller type
            than the canonical books, should be separately paged, with a
            special title, and with a preface and marginal notes where
            necessary. Their exclusion from all editions of the Bible was
            first insisted on by English and Scotch Puritans. This example
            was followed by the French, but not by the German, Swiss, and

            legalism, rigorous renunciation of the world, and a thorough
            earnestness, coupled with decision and energy of will, which
            nothing in the world can break or bend. It is the spirit of
            Calvin which impresses on it this character, and determines its
            doctrine. Only where Calvin's influence was less potent,
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            German Reformed, the catholicized Anglican Episcopal Church, and
            among the Cocceians, is this tendency less apparent or altogether
            wanting. On the other hand, often carried to the utmost extreme,
            it appears among the English Puritans (§§ 143, 3; <a href=
            "#Section_155_Para_1" class="tei tei-ref">155, 1</a>) and the
            French Huguenots (<a href="#Section_153_Para_4" class=

            and oppression.</p>

            "font-style: italic">England and Scotland.</span></em>—During the
            period of the English Revolution (§ 155, <a href=
            "#Section_155_Para_1" class="tei tei-ref">1</a>, <a href=
            "#Section_155_Para_2" class="tei tei-ref">2</a>), after the
            overthrow of Episcopacy, Puritanism became dominant; and the
            incongruous and contradictory elements already existing within it
            assumed exaggerated proportions (§ 143, 3, 4), until at last the
            opposing parties broke out into violent contentions with one
            another. The ideal of Scottish and English <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Presbyterianism</span></em> was the setting
            up of the kingdom of Christ as a theocracy, in which church and
            state were blended after the O.T. pattern. Hence all the
            institutions of church and state were to be founded on Scripture
            models, while all later developments were set aside as
            deteriorations from that standard. The ecclesiastical side of
            this ideal was to be realized by the establishment of a spiritual
            aristocracy represented in presbyteries and synods, which, ruling
            the presbyteries through the synods, and the congregations
            through the presbyteries, regarded itself as called and under
            obligation to inspect and supervise all the details of the
            private as well as public life of church members, and all this
            too by Divine right. Regarding their system as alone having
            divine institution, Presbyterians could not recognise any other
            religious or ecclesiastical party, and must demand uniformity,
            not only in regard to doctrine and creed, but also in regard to
            constitution, discipline, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">30</span></span></a>—On
            the other hand, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Independent Congregationalism</span></em>,
            inasmuch as it made prominent the N.T. ideas of the priesthood of
            all believers and spiritual freedom, demanded unlimited liberty
            to each separate congregation, and unconditional equality for all
            individual church members. It thus rejected the theocratic ideal
            of Presbyterianism, strove after a purely democratic
            constitution, and recognised toleration of all religious views as
            a fundamental principle of Christianity. Every attempt to secure
            uniformity and stability of forms of worship was regarded as a
            repressing of the Spirit of God operating in the church, and so
            alongside of the public services private conventicles abounded,
            in which believers sought to promote mutual edification. But soon
            amid the upheavals of this agitated period a fanatical spirit
            spread among the various sects of the Independents. The
            persecutions under Elizabeth and the Stuarts had awakened a
            longing for the return of the Lord, and the irresistible advance
            of Cromwell's army, composed mostly of Independents, made it
            appear as if the millennium was close at hand. Thus chiliasm came
            to be a fundamental principle of Independency, and soon too
            prophecy made its appearance to interpret and prepare the way for
            that which was coming. From the <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Believers</span></em> of the old Dutch times
            we now come to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Saints</span></em> of the early Cromwell
            period. These regarded themselves as called, in consequence of
            their being inspired by God's Spirit, to form the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“kingdom of the saints”</span> on earth promised in
            the last days, and hence also, from Daniel ii. and vii., they
            were called Fifth Monarchy Men. The so called Short Parliament of
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1653, in which
            these Saints were in a majority, had already laid the first
            stones of this structure by introducing civil marriage, with the
            strict enforcement, however, of Matthew v. 32, as well as by the
            abolition of all rights of patronage and all sorts of
            ecclesiastical taxes, when Cromwell dissolved it. The Saints had
            not and would not have any fixed, formulated theological system.
            They had, however, a most lively interest in doctrine, and
            produced a great diversity of Scripture expositions and dogmatic
            views, so that their deadly foes, the Presbyterians, could hurl
            against them old and new heretical designations by the hundred.
            The fundamental doctrine of predestination, common to all
            Puritans, was, even with them, for the most part, a
            presupposition of all theological speculation.</p>

            "Section_162_Para_2" id="Section_162_Para_2" class=

            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Saints</span></em> there appeared among the
            Independents the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Levellers</span></em>, political and social
            revolutionists, rather than an ecclesiastical and religious sect.
            They were unjustly charged <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page061">[pg 061]</span><a name="Pg061" id="Pg061" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> with claiming an equal distribution of
            goods. Over against the absolutist theories of the Stuarts, all
            the Independents maintained that the king, like all other civil
            magistrates, is answerable at all times and in all circumstances
            to the people, to whom all sovereignty originally and inalienably
            belongs. This principle was taken by the Levellers as the
            starting-point of their reforms. As their first regulative
            principle in reconstructing the commonwealth and determining the
            position of the church therein they did not take the theocratic
            constitution of the O.T., as the Presbyterians did, nor the
            biblical revelation of the N.T., as the moderate Independents
            did, nor even the modern professed prophecy of the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Saints,”</span> but the law of nature as the basis
            of all revelation, and already grounded in creation, with the
            sovereignty of the people as its ultimate foundation. While the
            rest of the Independents held by the idea of a Christian state,
            and only claimed that all Christian denominations, with the
            exception of the Catholics (<a href="#Section_153_Para_6" class=
            "tei tei-ref">§ 153, 6</a>), should enjoy all political rights,
            the Levellers demanded complete separation of church and state.
            This therefore implied, on the one hand, the non-religiousness of
            the state, and, on the other, again with the exception of
            Catholics, the absolute freedom, independence, and equality of
            all religious parties, even non-Christian sects and atheists. Yet
            all the while the Levellers themselves were earnestly and warmly
            attached to Christian truth as held by the other
            Independents.—Roger Williams (<a href="#Section_163_Para_3"
            class="tei tei-ref">§ 163, 3</a>), a Baptist minister, in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1631 transplanted
            the first seeds of Levellerism from England to North America, and
            by his writings helped again to spread those views in England.
            When he returned home in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1651 he found the
            sect already flourishing. The ablest leader of the English
            Levellers was John Lilburn. In <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1638, when scarcely
            twenty years old, he was flogged and sentenced to imprisonment
            for life, because he had printed Puritan writings in Holland and
            had them circulated in England. Released on the outbreak of the
            Revolution, he joined the Parliamentary army, was taken prisoner
            by the Royalists and sentenced to death, but escaped by flight.
            He was again imprisoned for writing libels on the House of Lords.
            Set free by the Rump Parliament, he became colonel in Cromwell's
            army, but was banished the country when it was found that the
            spread of radicalism endangered discipline. Till the dissolution
            of the Short Parliament his followers were in thorough sympathy
            with the Saints. Afterwards their ways went more and more apart;
            the Saints drifted into Quakerism (<a href="#Section_163_Para_4"
            class="tei tei-ref">§ 163, 4</a>), while the Levellers
            degenerated into deism (<a href="#Section_164_Para_3" class=
            "tei tei-ref">§ 164, 3</a>).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><a name=
            "Section_162_Para_3" id="Section_162_Para_3" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> 3. Out of the religious commotion
            prevailing in England before, during, and after the Revolution
            there sprang up a voluminous <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">devotional
            literature</span></em>, intended to give guidance and directions
            for holy <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page062">[pg
            062]</span><a name="Pg062" id="Pg062" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            living. Its influence was felt in foreign lands, especially in
            the Reformed churches of the continent, and even German Lutheran
            Pietism was not unaffected by it (<a href="#Section_159_Para_3"
            class="tei tei-ref">§ 159, 3</a>). That this movement was not
            confined to the Puritans, among whom it had its origin, is seen
            from the fact that during the seventeenth century many such
            treatises were issued from the University Press of Cambridge.

            the basis of a liberal classical training received in youth, all
            the motive powers of Independency, from the original Puritan zeal
            for the faith and Reformation to the politico-social radicalism
            of the Levellers, combined in full and vigorous operation. From
            Italy, the beloved land of classical science and artistic
            culture, he was called back to England in <span class=

            the thunder of his controversial treatises ring over the
            battlefield of parties. He fought against the narrowness of
            Presbyterian control of conscience not less energetically than
            against the hierarchism of the Episcopal church; vindicates the
            permissibility of divorce (in view, no doubt, of his own first

            by the hangman, but he himself was left unmolested. He now

            period, when he had probably turned his back on all existing

            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1645 as military
            chaplain, hoping to moderate, if not to check, their

            recovery he returned to his former post as assistant-minister at
            Kidderminster in Worcestershire, and there remained till driven
            out by the Act of Uniformity of <span class=

            fourteen years formed the period of his most successful labours.
            He then composed most of his numerous devotional works, three of
            which, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Saint's Everlasting

            when, on conscientious grounds, he refused a bishopric, he met
            only with persecution, ill treatment, and imprisonment. Through
            William's Act of Toleration of <span class=

            allowed to pass the last year of his life in London. On the
            doctrine of predestination he took the moderate position of
            Amyrault (<a href="#Section_161_Para_3" class="tei tei-ref">§

            Presbyterianism and Episcopacy, by restoring the original
            episcopal constitution of the second century, when even the
            smaller churches had each its own bishop with a presbytery by his

            the close of the war he married a poor girl from a Puritan
            family, whose only marriage portion consisted in two Puritan
            books of devotion. It was now that the birthday of a new
            spiritual life began to dawn in him. He joined the Baptist
            Independents, the most zealous of the Saints of that time, was
            baptized by them in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            the country as a preacher, attracting thousands around him
            everywhere by his glorious eloquence. In <span class=

            settled in Bedford, and from this time till his death, amid
            persecution and oppression, continued his itinerant preaching

            a struggle overcoming all hindrances to secure an entrance into
            the heavenly Zion above. It has passed through numberless

            the Reformed Pietism was transplanted to the Netherlands, where
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">William
            Teellinck</span></em> may be regarded as its founder. After
            finishing his legal studies he resided for a while in England,
            where he made the acquaintance of the Puritans and their
            writings, and was deeply impressed with their earnest and pious
            family life. He then went to Leyden to study theology, and in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1606 began a
            ministry that soon bore fruit. He was specially blessed at
            Middelburg in Zealand, where he died <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1629. His writings,
            larger and smaller, more than a hundred in number, in which a
            peculiar sweetness of mystical love for the Redeemer is combined
            with stern Calvinistic views, after the style of St. Bernard,
            were circulated widely in numerous editions, eagerly read in many
            lands, and for fully a century exerted a powerful influence
            throughout the whole Reformed church. Teellinck in no particular
            departed from the prevailing orthodoxy, but unwittingly toned
            down its harshness in his tracts, and with the gentleness
            characteristic of him counselled brotherly forbearance amid the
            bitterness of the Arminian controversy. In spite of much
            hostility, which his best efforts could not prevent, many
            university theologians stood by his side as warm admirers of his
            writings. It will not be wondered at that among these was the
            pious Amesius of Franeker (<a href="#Section_161_Para_7" class=
            "tei tei-ref">§ 161, 7</a>), the scholar of the able Perkins (§
            143, 5); but it is more surprising to find here the powerful
            champion of scholastic orthodoxy, Voetius of Utrecht, and his
            vigorous partisan, Hoornbeeck of Leyden. <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=

            He opened his academic course in <span class=

            Reformed Church between <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Voetians and Cocceians</span></em>,
            beginning in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1658, the former
            favoured the pietistic movement. In the German Pietist
            controversy the Cocceians were with the Pietists in their
            biblical orthodoxy joined with confessional indifferentism, but
            with the orthodox in their liberality and breadth on matters of
            life and conduct. The earnest, practical piety of the Voetians,
            again, made them sympathise with the Lutheran Pietists, and their
            zeal for pure doctrine and the Church confession brought them
            into relation with the orthodox Lutherans. As discord between the
            theologians arose over the obligation of the Sabbath law, so the
            difference among the people arose out of the question of Sabbath
            observance. The Voetians maintained that the decalogue
            prohibition of any form of work on Sabbath was still fully
            binding, while the Cocceians, on the ground of Mark ii. 27,
            Galatians iv. 9, Colossians ii. 16, etc., denied its continued
            obligation, their wives often, to the annoyance of the Voetians,
            sitting in the windows after Divine service with their knitting
            or sewing. But the opposition did not stop there; it spread into
            all departments of life. The Voetians set great value upon
            fasting and private meditation, avoided all public games and
            plays, dressed plainly, and observed a simple, pious mode of
            life; their pastors wore a clerical costume, etc. The Cocceians,
            again, fell in with the customs of the time, mingled freely in
            the mirth and pastimes of the people, went to public festivals
            and entertainments, their women dressed in elegant, stylish
            attire, their pastors were not bound by hard and fast symbols,
            but had full Scripture freedom, etc.—Continuation, <a href=

            the Romanic-Calvinistic party in doctrine, worship, and life
            greatly modified; but where the Reformed element was predominant,
            as in the Lower Rhine, it was correspondingly affected by a

            the Reformed church had outlets for its Christian love in the
            work of foreign missions; on the one side by the cession of the
            Portuguese East Indian colonies to the Netherlands in the
            beginning of the seventeenth century, and on the other side by
            the continuous formation of English colonies in North America
            throughout the whole century. In regard to missionary effort, the
            Dutch government followed in the footsteps of her Portuguese
            predecessors. She insisted that all natives, before getting a
            situation, should be baptized and have signed the Belgic
            Confession, and many who fulfilled these conditions remained as
            they had been before. But the English Puritans settled in America
            showed a zeal for the conversion of the Indians more worthy of
            the Protestant name. John Eliot, who is rightly styled the
            apostle of the Indians, devoted himself with unwearied and
            self-denying love for half a century to this task. He translated
            the Bible into their language, and founded seventeen Indian
            stations, of which during his lifetime ten were destroyed in a
            bloody war. Eliot's work was taken up by the Mayhew family, who
            for five generations wrought among the Indians. The last of the

            blending of Catholic quietist mysticism and Calvinistic
            Augustinianism. Besides those regular sects, there were various
            individual enthusiasts and separatists. These were most rife in
            the Netherlands, where the free civil constitution afforded a
            place of refuge for all exiles on account of their faith. Here
            only was the press free enough to serve as a thoroughgoing

            since 1600 under James Sieninski, son of the founder, recognised
            Socinianism as the established religion; and an academy was
            formed there which soon occupied a distinguished position, and
            gave such reputation to the place that it could be spoken of as
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the Sarmatian Athens.”</span> But the
            congregation at Lublin, next in importance to that of Racau, was
            destroyed as early as 1627 by the mob under fanatical excitement
            caused by the Jesuits. The same disaster befell Racau itself
            eleven years later. A couple of idle schoolboys had thrown stones
            at a wooden crucifix standing before the city gate, and had been
            for this severely punished by their parents, and turned out of
            school. The Catholics, however, made a complaint before the
            senate, where the Jesuits secured a sentence that the school
            should be destroyed, the church taken from <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“the Arians,”</span> the printing press closed, but
            the ministers and teachers outlawed and branded with infamy. And
            the Jesuits did not rest until the Reichstag at Warsaw in 1658
            issued decrees of banishment against <span class="tei tei-q">“all
            Arians,”</span> and forbad the profession of <span class=

            "font-style: italic">Germany</span></em> Socinianism had, even in
            the beginning of the century, a secret nursery in the University
            of Altdorf, belonging to the territory of the imperial city of
            Nuremberg. Soner, professor of medicine, had been won over to
            this creed by Socinians residing at Leyden, where he had studied
            in 1597, 1598, and now used his official position at Altdorf for,
            not only instilling his Unitarian doctrines by means of private
            philosophical conversations into the minds of his numerous
            students, who flocked to him from Poland, Transylvania, and
            Hungary, but also for securing the adhesion of several German
            students. Only after his death in 1612 did the Nuremberg council
            come to know about this propaganda. A strict investigation was
            then made, all Poles were expelled, and all the Socinian writings
            that could be discovered were burned.—The later Polish Exultants
            sought and found refuge in Germany, especially in Silesia,
            Prussia, and Brandenburg, as well as in the Reformed Palatinate,
            and also founded some small Unitarian congregations, which,
            however, after maintaining for a while a miserable existence,
            gradually passed out of view. They had greater success and spread
            more widely in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Netherlands</span></em>, till the
            states-general of 1653, in consequence of repeated synodal
            protests, and on the ground of an opinion given by the University
            of Leyden, issued a strict edict against the Unitarians, who now
            gradually passed over to the ranks of the Remonstrants (<a href=
            "#Section_161_Para_2" class="tei tei-ref">§ 161, 2</a>) and the
            Collegiants. Also in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">England</span></em>, since the time of Henry
            VIII., antitrinitarian confessors and martyrs were to be found.
            Even in 1611, under James I., three of them had been consigned to
            the flames. The Polish Socinians took occasion from this to send
            the king a Racovian Catechism; but in 1614 it was, by order of
            parliament, burned by the hands of the hangman. The Socinians
            were also excluded from the benefit of the Act of Toleration of
            1689, which was granted to all other dissenters (<a href=
            "#Section_155_Para_3" class="tei tei-ref">§ 155, 3</a>). The
            progress of deism, however, among the upper classes (§§ <a href=

            prevent the extreme penal laws being carried into execution.—The
            following are the most distinguished among the numerous learned
            theologians of the Augustan age of Socinian scholarship, who
            contributed to the extending, establishing, and vindicating of
            the system of their church by exegetical, dogmatic, and polemical
            writings: John Crell, died 1631; Jonas Schlichting, died 1661;
            Von Wolzogen, died 1661; and Andr. Wissowatius, a grandson of
            Faustus Socinus, died 1678; and with these must also be ranked

            again divided during the Arminian controversy into Remonstrants
            and Predestinationists. The former, from their leader, were
            called Galenists, and from having a lamb as the symbol of their
            Church, Lambists. The latter were called Apostoolers from their
            leader, and Sunists because their churches had the figure of the
            sun as a symbol. The Lambists, who acknowledged no confession of
            faith, were most numerous. In <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1800, however, a
            union of the two parties was effected, the Sunists adopting the
            doctrinal position of the Lambists.—During the time when Arminian
            pastors were banished from the Netherlands, three brothers Van
            der Kodde founded a sect of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Collegiants</span></em>, which repudiated
            the clerical office, assigned preaching and dispensation of
            sacraments to laymen, and baptized only adults by immersion.
            Their place of baptism was Rhynsburg on the Rhine, and hence they
            were called Rhynsburgers. Their other name was given them from
            their assemblies, which they styled <span lang="la" class=

            flourishing Baptist congregations in Moravia, and the reaction

            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1622 a decree for
            their banishment was issued, and these quiet, inoffensive men
            were again homeless fugitives. Remnants of them fled into Hungary
            and Transylvania, only to meet new persecutions there. A letter
            of protection from Leopold I., <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1659, secured them
            the right of settling in three counties around Pressburg. But
            soon these rigorous persecutions broke out afresh; they were
            beset by Jesuits seeking to convert them, and when this failed
            they were driven out or annihilated. At last, by <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1757-1762, they
            were completely broken up, and most of them had joined the Roman
            Catholic church. A few families preserved their faith by flight
            into South Russia, where they settled in Wirschenka. When the
            Toleration Edict of Joseph II., of <span class=

            religious freedom to Protestants in Austria, several returned
            again to the faith of their fathers, in the hope that the
            toleration would be extended to them; but they were bitterly
            disappointed. They now betook themselves to Russia, and together
            with their brethren already there, settled in the Crimea, where
            they still constitute the colony of Hutersthal.</p>

            supporters of the practice of the church in regard to baptism to
            a large extent occupied common ground with its opponents. The

            poor Presbyterian weaver in Drayton, Leicestershire. After scant
            schooling he went to learn shoemaking at Nottingham, but in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1643 abandoned the
            trade. Harassed by spiritual conflicts, he wandered about seeking
            peace for his soul. Upon hearing an Independent preach on 2 Peter
            i. 19, he was moved loudly to contradict the preacher.
            <span class="tei tei-q">“What we have to do with,”</span> he
            said, <span class="tei tei-q">“is not the word, but the Spirit by
            which those men of God spake and wrote.”</span> He was seized as
            a disturber of public worship, but was soon after released. In
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1649 he travelled
            the country preaching and teaching, addressing every man as
            <span class="tei tei-q">“thou,”</span> raising his hat to none,
            greeting none, attracting thousands by his preaching, often
            imprisoned, flogged, tortured, hunted like a wild beast. The core
            of his preaching was, not Scripture, but the Spirit, not Christ
            without but Christ within, not outward worship, not churches,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“steeple-houses,”</span> and bells, not
            doctrines and sacraments, but only the inner light, which is
            kindled by God in the conscience of every man, renewed and
            quickened by the Spirit of Christ, which suddenly lays hold upon
            it. The number of his followers increased from day to day. In
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            along with his friends, a kindly shelter in the house of Thomas
            Fell, of Smarthmore near Preston, and in his wife Margaret a
            motherly <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page071">[pg

            themselves <span class="tei tei-q">“The Society of

            by a violent judge, whom Fox bad <span class="tei tei-q">“quake
            before the word of God.”</span> After the overthrow of the hopes
            of the Saints through the dissolution of the Short Parliament and
            Cromwell's apostasy (<a href="#Section_155_Para_2" class=
            "tei tei-ref">§ 155, 2</a>), many of them joined the Quakers, and
            led them into revolutionary and fanatical excesses. Confined
            hitherto to the northern counties, they now spread in London and
            Bristol, and over all the south of England. In January,
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            fortnight's general meeting at Swannington, in Leicestershire.
            Crowds of apostles went over into Ireland, to North America and
            the West Indies, to Holland, Germany, France, and Italy, and even
            to Constantinople. They did not meet with great success. In Italy
            they encountered the Inquisition, and in North America the
            severest penal laws were passed against them. In <span class=

            one of their most famous leaders, celebrated at Bristol the
            second coming of Christ <span class="tei tei-q">“in the
            Spirit,”</span> by enacting the scene of Christ's triumphal entry
            into Jerusalem. But the king of the new Israel was scourged,
            branded on the forehead with the letter B as a blasphemer, had
            his tongue pierced with a redhot iron, and was then cast into
            prison. Many absurd extravagances of this kind, which drew down
            upon them frequent persecutions, as well as the failure of their
            foreign missionary enterprises, brought most of the Quakers to
            adopt more sober views. The great mother Quakeress, Margaret
            Fell, exercised a powerful influence in this direction. George
            Fox, too, out of whose hands the movement had for a long time
            gone, now lent his aid. Naylor himself, in <span class=

            direction of sobriety and common sense was carried out to its
            fullest extent during the Stuart Restoration, <span class=

            Abandoning their revolutionary tendencies through dislike to
            Cromwell's violence, and giving up most of their fanatical
            extravagances, the Quakers became models of quiet, orderly
            living. Robert Barclay, by his <span class=

            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1673, gave a sort
            of symbolic expression to their belief, and vindicated his
            doctrinal positions in his <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang=

            period many of them laid down their lives for their faith. On the
            other side of the sea they formed powerful settlements,
            distinguished for religious toleration and brotherly love. The
            chief promoter of this new departure was <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">William
            Penn</span></em>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1644-1718, son of
            an English admiral, who, while a student at Oxford, was impressed
            by a Quaker's preaching, and led to attend the prayer and
            fellowship meetings of the Friends. In order to break his
            connexion <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page072">[pg

            with this party, his father sent him, in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1661, to travel in
            France and Italy. The frivolity of the French court failed to
            attract him, but for a long time he was spellbound by Amyrault's
            theological lectures at Saumur. On his return home, in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1664, he seemed to
            have completely come back to a worldly life, when once again he
            was arrested by a Quaker's preaching. In <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1668 he formally
            joined the society. For a controversial tract, <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">The Sandy
            Foundation Shaken</span></em>, he was sent for six months to the
            Tower, where he composed the famous tract, <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">No Cross, no
            Crown</span></em>, and a treatise in his own vindication,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Innocency with her Open Face.”</span>
            His father, who, shortly before his death in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1670, was
            reconciled to his son, left him a yearly income of £1,500, with a
            claim on Government for £16,000. In spite of continued
            persecution and oppression he continued unweariedly to promote
            the cause of Quakerism by speech and pen. In <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1677, in company
            with Fox and Barclay, he made a tour through Holland and Germany.
            In both countries he formed many friendships, but did not succeed
            in establishing any societies. His hopes now turned to North
            America, where Fox had already wrought with success during the
            times of sorest persecution, <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>
            1671, 1672, In lieu of his father's claim, he obtained from
            Government a large tract of land on the Delaware, with the right
            of colonizing and organizing it under English suzerainty. Twice
            he went out for this purpose himself, in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1682 and 1699, and
            formed the Quaker state of Pennsylvania, with Philadelphia as its
            capital. The first principle of its constitution was universal
            religious toleration, even to Catholics.<a id="noteref_38" name=

            At their services any man or woman, if moved by the Spirit, might
            pray, teach, or exhort, or if no one felt so impelled they would
            sit on in silence. Their meeting-houses had not the form or
            fittings of churches, their devotional services had neither
            singing nor music. They repudiated water baptism, alike of
            infants and adults, and recognised only baptism of the Spirit.

            Belief of the Quakers</span></em> is completely dominated by its
            central dogma of the <span class="tei tei-q">“inner
            light,”</span> which is identified with reason and conscience as
            the common heritage of mankind. Darkened and weakened by the
            fall, it is requickened in us by the Spirit of the glorified
            Christ, and possesses us as an inner spiritual Christ, an inner
            Word of God. The Bible is recognised as the outer word of God,
            but is useful only as a means of arousing the inner word. The
            Calvinistic doctrine of election is decidedly rejected, and also
            that of vicarious satisfaction. But also the doctrines of the
            fall, original sin, justification by faith, as well as that of
            the Trinity, are very much set aside in favour of an indefinite
            subjective theology of feeling. The operation of the Holy Spirit
            in man's redemption and salvation outside of Christendom is
            frankly admitted. On the other hand, the ethical-practical
            element, as shown in works of benevolence, in the battle for
            religious freedom, for the abolition of slavery, etc., is brought
            to the front. In regard to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            have distinguished themselves in all domestic, civil, industrial,
            and mercantile movements by quiet, peaceful industry, strict
            integrity, and simple habits, so that not only did they amass
            great wealth, but gained the confidence and respect of those
            around. They refused to take oaths or to serve as soldiers, or to
            engage in sports, or to indulge in any kind of luxury. In social
            intercourse they declined to acknowledge any titles of rank,
            would not bow or raise the hat to any, but addressed all by the
            simple <span class="tei tei-q">“thou.”</span> Their men wore
            broad-brimmed hats, a plain, simple coat, without collar or
            buttons, fastened by hooks. Their women wore a simple gray silk
            dress, with like coloured bonnet, without ribbon, flower, or
            feathers, and a plain shawl. Wearing mourning dress was regarded
            as a heathenish custom.<a id="noteref_39" name="noteref_39" href=

            de Labadie, the scion of an ancient noble family, born
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1610, was educated
            in the Jesuit school at Bordeaux, entered the order, and became a
            priest, but was released from office at his own wish in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1639, on account of
            delicate health. Even in the Jesuit college the principles that
            manifested themselves <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page074">[pg
            074]</span><a name="Pg074" id="Pg074" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            in his later life began to take root in him. By Scripture study
            he was led to adopt almost Augustinian views of sin and grace, as
            well as the conviction of the need of a revival of the church
            after the apostolic pattern. This tendency was confirmed and
            deepened by the influence of Spanish Quietism, which even the
            Jesuits had favoured to some extent. In the interest of these
            views he wrought laboriously for eleven years as Catholic priest
            in Amiens, Paris, and other places, amid the increasing hostility
            of the Jesuits. Their persecution, together with a growing
            clearness in his Augustinian convictions, led him formally to go
            over to the Reformed church in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1650. He now
            laboured for seven years as Reformed pastor at Montauban. In
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1657, owing to
            political suspicions against him spread by the Jesuits, he
            withdrew from Montauban, and, after two years' labour at Orange,
            settled at Geneva, where his preaching and household visitations
            bore abundant fruit. In <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1666 he accepted a
            call to Middelburg, in Zealand. There he was almost as successful
            as he had been in Geneva; but there too it began to appear that
            in him there burned a fire strange to the Reformed church. The
            French Reformed synod took great offence at his refusal to sign
            the Belgic Confession. It was found that at many points he was
            not in sympathy with the church standards, that he had written in
            favour of chiliasm and the Apokatastasis, that in regard to the
            nature and idea of the church and its need of a reformation he
            was not in accord with the views of the Reformed church. The
            synod in 1668 suspended him from office, and, as he did not
            confess his errors, in the following year deposed him. Labadie
            then saw that what he regarded as his lifework, the restoration
            of the apostolic church, was as little attainable within the
            Reformed as within the Catholic church. He therefore organized
            his followers into a separate denomination, and was, together
            with them, banished by the magistrate. The neighbouring town of
            Veere received them gladly, but Middelburg now persuaded the
            Zealand council to issue a decree banishing them from that town
            also. The people of Veere were ready to defy this order, but
            Labadie thought it better to avoid the risk of a civil war by
            voluntary withdrawal; and so he went, in August, <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1669, with about
            forty followers, to Amsterdam, where he laid the foundations of
            an apostolic church. This new society consisted of a sort of
            monastic household consisting only of the regenerate. They hired
            a commodious house, and from thence sent out spiritual workers as
            missionaries, to spread the principles of the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“new church”</span> throughout the land. Within a
            year they numbered 60,000 souls. They dispensed the sacrament
            according to the Reformed rite, and preached the gospel in
            conventicles. The most important gain to the party was the
            adhesion of Anna Maria von Schürman, born at Cologne <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1607 of a Reformed

            mother in Utrecht, celebrated for her unexampled attainment in
            languages, science, and art. When in <span class=

            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1670, the
            government, urged by the synod, forbad attendance on the
            Labadists' preaching, the accomplished and pious
            Countess-palatine Elizabeth, sister of the elector-palatine, and
            abbess of the rich cloister of Herford, whose intimate friend
            Schürman had been for forty years, gave them an asylum in the
            capital of her little state.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><a name=
            "Section_163_Para_8" id="Section_163_Para_8" class=

            Hollanders”</span> met with bitter opposition from the Lutheran
            clergy, the magistracy, and populace, and were treated by the mob
            with insult and scorn. They themselves also gave only too good
            occasion for ridicule. At a sacramental celebration, the aged
            Labadie and still older Schürman embraced and kissed each other
            and began to dance for joy. In his sermons and writings Labadie
            set forth the Quietist doctrines of the limitation of Christ's
            life and sufferings in the mortification of the flesh, the duty
            of silent prayer, the sinking of the soul into the depths of the
            Godhead, the community of goods, etc. Special offence was given
            by the private marriage of the three leaders, Labadie, Yvon, and
            Dulignon with young wealthy ladies of society, and their views of
            marriage among the regenerate as an institution for raising up a
            pure seed free from original sin and brought forth without pain.
            The Elector of Brandenburg, hitherto favourable, as guardian of
            the seminary was obliged, in answer to the complaints of the
            Herford magistracy, to appoint a commission of inquiry. Labadie
            wrote a defence, which was published in Latin, Dutch, and German,
            in which he endeavoured to harmonize his mystical views with the
            doctrines of the Reformed church. But in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1671 the
            magistrates obtained a mandate from the imperial court at Spires,
            which threatened the abbess with the ban if she continued to
            harbour the sectaries. In <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1672 Labadie
            settled in Altona, where he died in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1674. His
            followers, numbering 160, remained here undisturbed till the war
            between Denmark and Sweden broke out in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1675. They then
            retired to the castle of Waltha in West Friesland, the property
            of three sisters belonging to the party. Schürman died in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1678, Dulignon in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1679, and Yvon, who

            institution of the community of goods, after a trial of eighteen
            years, being able to pay back much less than he had received.
            After his death in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            gradually fell off, and after the property had gone into other

            reforms. Of much greater importance was <em class=

            "font-style: italic">Russian Sects.</span></em>—A vast number of
            sects sprang up within the Russian church, which are all included
            under the general name <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Raskolniks</span></em> or apostates. They
            fall into two great classes in their distinctive character,
            diametrically opposed the one to the other. (1) The <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page077">[pg 077]</span><a name="Pg077" id=
            "Pg077" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Starowerzi</span></em>, or Old Believers.
            They originated in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1652, in
            consequence of the liturgical reform of the learned and powerful
            patriarch Nikon, which called forth the violent opposition of a
            large body of the peasantry, who loved the old forms. Besides
            stubborn adhesion to the old liturgy, they rejected all modern
            customs and luxuries, held it sinful to cut the beard, to smoke
            tobacco, to drink tea and coffee, etc. The Starowerzi, numbering
            some ten millions, are to this day distinguished by their pure
            and simple lives, and are split up into three parties: (i.)
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Jedinowerzi</span></em>, who are nearest to
            the orthodox church, recognise its priesthood, and are different
            only in their religious ceremonies and the habits of their social
            life; (ii.) The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Starovbradzi</span></em>, who do not
            recognise the priesthood of the orthodox church; and (iii.) the
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Bespopowtschini</span></em>, who have no
            priests, but only elders, and are split up into various smaller
            sects. Under the peasant Philip Pustosiwät, a party of
            Starowerzi, called from their leader Philippius, fled during the
            persecution of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1700 from the
            government of Olonez, and settled in Polish Lithuania and East
            Prussia, where to the number of 1,200 souls they live to this day
            in villages in the district of Gumbinnen, engaged in agricultural
            pursuits, and observing the rites of the old Russian church.—(2)
            At the very opposite pole from the Starowerzi stand the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">Heretical Sects</span></span>, which
            repudiate and condemn everything in the shape of external church
            organization, and manifest a tendency in some cases toward
            fanatical excess, and in other cases toward rationalistic
            spiritualism. As the sects showing the latter tendency did not
            make their appearance till the eighteenth century (<a href=
            "#Section_166_Para_2" class="tei tei-ref">§ 166, 2</a>), we have
            here to do only with those of the former class. The most
            important of these sects is that of the <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Men of
            God</span></em>, or Spiritual Christians, who trace their origin
            from a peasant, Danila Filipow, of the province of Wladimir. In
            1645, say they, the divine Father, seated on a cloud of flame,
            surrounded by angels, descended from heaven on Mount Gorodin in a
            chariot of fire, in order to restore true Christianity in its
            original purity and spirituality. For this purpose he incarnated
            himself in Filipow's pure body. He commanded his followers, who
            in large numbers, mainly drawn from the peasant class, gathered
            around him, not to marry, and if already married to put away
            their wives, to abstain from all intoxicating drinks, to be
            present neither at marriages nor baptisms, but above all things
            to believe that there is no other god besides him. After some
            years he adopted as his son another peasant, Ivan Suslow, who was
            said to have been born of a woman a hundred years old, by
            communicating to him in his thirtieth year his own divine nature.
            Ivan, as a new Christ, sent out twelve apostles to spread his
            doctrine. The Czar Alexis put him and forty of his adherents into
            prison; but neither the knout nor the rack could wring from them
            the mysteries <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page078">[pg
            078]</span><a name="Pg078" id="Pg078" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            of their faith and worship. At last, on a Friday, the czar caused
            the new Christ to be crucified; but on the following Sunday he
            appeared risen again among his disciples. After some years the
            imprisoning, crucifying, and resurrection were repeated.
            Imprisoned a third time in 1672, he owed his liberation to an
            edict of grace on the occasion of the birth of the Prince Peter
            the Great. He now lived at Moscow along with the divine father
            Filipow, who had hitherto consulted his own safety by living in
            concealment in the enjoyment of the adoration of his followers
            unmolested for thirty years, supported by certain wealthy
            merchants. Filipow is said to have ascended up in the presence of
            many witnesses, in 1700, into the seventh and highest heaven,
            where he immediately seated himself on the throne as the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Lord of Hosts,”</span> and the Christ,
            Suslow, also returned thither in 1716, after both had reached the
            hundredth year of the human existence. As Suslow's successor
            appeared a new Christ in Prokopi Lupkin, and, after his death, in
            1732, arose Andr. Petrow. The last Christ manifestation was
            revealed in the person of the unfortunate Czar Peter III.,
            dethroned by his wife Catharine II. in 1762, who, living
            meanwhile in secret, shall soon return, to the terrible confusion
            of all unbelievers. With this the historical tradition of the
            earlier sect of the Men of God is brought to a close, and in the
            Skopsen, or Eunuchs, who also venerate the Czar Peter III. as the
            Christ that is to come again, a new development of the sect has
            arisen, carrying out its principles more and more fully (<a href=
            "#Section_210_Para_4" class="tei tei-ref">§ 210, 4</a>). Other
            branches of the same party, among which, as also among the
            Skopsen, the fanatical endeavour to mortify the flesh is carried
            to the most extravagant length, are the Morelschiki or
            Self-Flagellators, the Dumbies, who will not, even under the
            severest tortures, utter a sound, etc. The ever-increasing
            development of this sect-forming craze, which found its way into
            several monasteries and nunneries, led to repeated judicial
            investigations, the penitent being sentenced for their fault to
            confinement in remote convents, and the obdurate being visited
            with severe corporal punishments and even with death. The chief
            sources of information regarding the history, doctrine, and
            customs of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Men of God”</span> and
            the Skopsen are their own numerous spiritual songs, collected by
            Prof. Ivan Dobrotworski of Kasan, which were sung in their
            assemblies for worship with musical accompaniment and solemn
            dances. On these occasions their prophets and prophetesses were
            wont to prophesy, and a kind of sacramental supper was celebrated
            with bread and water. The sacraments of the Lord's supper and
            baptism, as administered by the orthodox church, are repudiated
            and scorned, the latter as displaced by the only effectual
            baptism of the Spirit. They have, indeed, in order to avoid
            persecution, been obliged to take part in the services of the
            orthodox national church, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The mediæval
            scholastic philosophy had outlived itself, even in the
            pre-Reformation age; yet it maintained a lingering existence side
            by side with those new forms which the modern spirit in
            philosophy was preparing for itself. We hear an echo of the
            philosophical ferment of the sixteenth century in the Italian
            Dominican Campanella, and in the Englishman Bacon of Verulam we
            meet the pioneer of that modern philosophy which had its proper
            founder in Descartes. Spinoza, Locke, and Leibnitz were in
            succession the leaders of this philosophical development.
            Alongside of this philosophy, and deriving its weapons from it
            for attack upon theology and the church, a number of freethinkers
            also make their appearance. These, like their more radical
            disciples in the following century, regarded Scripture as
            delusive, and nature and reason as alone trustworthy sources of
            religious knowledge.</p>

            philosophy and scholastic theology, and gave himself to the study

            republican tendencies, the Spanish government put him in prison

            the real author of empiricism in philosophy and the realistic
            methods of modern times. His public life, however, is clouded by

            proposition. Beginning with doubt, he rose by pure thinking to
            the knowledge of the true and certain in things. The imperfection
            of the soul thus discovered suggests an absolutely perfect Being,
            to whose perfection the attribute of being belongs. This is the
            ontological proof for the being of God.—His philosophy was
            zealously taken up by French Jansenists and Oratorians and the
            Reformed theologians of Holland, while it was bitterly opposed by

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Essay concerning Human

            seeks to show that all our notions are only products of outer or

            as an apology for Christianity, and even for biblical visions and

            a Hanoverian statesman, who died <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1716, introduced
            the new German philosophy in its first stage. The philosophy of
            Leibnitz is opposed at once to the theosophy of Paracelsus and
            Böhme and to the empiricism of Bacon and Locke, the pantheism of
            Spinoza, and the scepticism and manichæism of Bayle. It is indeed
            a Christian philosophy not fully developed. But inasmuch as at
            the same time it adopted, improved upon, and carried out the
            rationalism of Descartes, it also paved the way for the later
            theological rationalism. The foundation of his philosophy is the
            theory of monads wrought out in his <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“<span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "fr"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Theodicée</span></span>”</span> against
            Bayle and in his <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="fr" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Nouveaux Essais</span></span>,”</span>
            against Locke. In opposition to the atomic theory of the
            materialists, he regarded all phenomena in the world as
            eccentricities of so called monads, <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>
            primary simple and indivisible substances, each of which is a
            miniature of the whole universe. Out of these monads that radiate
            out from God, the primary monad, the world is formed into a
            harmony once for all admired of God: the theory of
            pre-established harmony. This must be the best of worlds,
            otherwise it would not have been. In opposition to Bayle, who had
            argued in a manichæan fashion against God's goodness and wisdom
            from the existence of evil, Leibnitz seeks to show <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page082">[pg 082]</span><a name="Pg082" id=
            "Pg082" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> that this does not contradict
            the idea of the best of worlds, nor that of the Divine goodness
            and wisdom, since finity and imperfection belong to the very
            notion of creature, a metaphysical evil from which moral evil
            inevitably follows, yet not so as to destroy the pre-established
            harmony. Against Locke he maintains the doctrine of innate ideas,
            contests Clarke's theory of indeterminism, maintains the
            agreement of philosophy with revelation, which indeed is above
            but not contrary to reason, and hopes to prove his system by
            mathematical demonstration.<a id="noteref_46" name="noteref_46"

            the age to throw off all positive Christianity first showed
            itself openly in England as the final outcome of Levellerism
            (<a href="#Section_162_Para_2" class="tei tei-ref">§ 162, 2</a>).
            This movement has been styled naturalism, because it puts natural
            in place of revealed religion, and deism, because in place of the
            redeeming work of the triune God it admits only a general
            providence of the one God. On philosophic grounds the English
            deists affirmed the impossibility of revelation, inspiration,
            prophecy, and miracle, and on critical grounds rejected them from
            the Bible and history. The simple religious system of deism
            embraced God, providence, freedom of the will, virtue, and the
            immortality of the soul. The Christian doctrines of the Trinity,
            original sin, satisfaction, justification, resurrection, etc.,
            were regarded as absurd and irrational. Deism in England spread
            almost exclusively among upper-class laymen; the people and
            clergy stood firmly to their positive beliefs. Theological
            controversial tracts were numerous, but their polemical force was
            in great measure lost by the latitudinarianism of their
            authors.—The principal English deists of the century were (1)
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Edward

            nobleman and statesman. He reduced all religion to five points:
            Faith in God, the duty of reverencing Him, especially by leading
            an upright life, atoning for sin by genuine repentance,
            recompense in the life eternal.—(2) <em class=

            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1588-1679, an acute
            philosophical and political writer, looked on Christianity as an
            oriental phantom, and of value only as a support of absolute
            monarchy and an antidote to revolution. The state of nature is a

            <span style="font-size: 120%">§ 165. The Roman Catholic
            Church.</span></h3>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">During the
            first half of the century the Roman hierarchy suffered severely
            at the hand of Catholic courts, while in the second half storms
            gathered from all sides, threatening its very existence.
            Portugal, France, Spain, and Italy rested not till they got the
            pope himself to strike the deathblow to the Jesuits, who had been
            his chief supporters indeed, but who had now become his masters.
            Soon after the German bishops threatened to free themselves and
            their people from Rome, and what reforms they could not effect by
            ecclesiastical measures the emperor undertook to effect by civil
            measures. Scarcely had this danger been overcome when the horrors
            of the French Revolution broke out, which sought, along with the
            Papacy, to overthrow Christianity as well. But, on the other
            hand, during the early decades of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page085">[pg 085]</span><a name="Pg085" id="Pg085" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> the century Catholicism had gained many
            victories in another way by the counter-reformation and
            conversions. Its foreign missions, however, begun with such
            promise of success, came to a sad end, and even the home missions
            faded away, in spite of the founding of various new orders. The
            Jansenist controversy in the beginning of the century entered on
            a new stage, the Catholic church being driven into open
            semi-Pelagianism, and Jansenism into fanatical excesses. The
            church theology sank very low, and the Catholic supporters of
            <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            exceeded in number those who had fallen away to it from
            Protestantism.</p>

            XI.</span></em>, 1700-1721, protested in vain against the Elector
            Frederick III. of Brandenburg assuming the crown as King
            Frederick I. of Prussia, on Jan. 18th, <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1701. In the
            Spanish wars of succession he sought to remain neutral, but force
            of circumstances led him to take up a position adverse to German
            interests. The new German emperor, Joseph I., <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1705-1711, scorned
            to seek confirmation from the pope, and Clement consequently had
            the usual prayer for the emperor omitted in the church services.
            The relations became yet more strained, owing to a dispute about
            the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "la"><span style="font-style: italic">jus primarum
            precum</span></span>, Joseph claiming the right to revenues of
            vacancies as the patron. In <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1707, the pope had
            the joy of seeing the German army driven out, not only of
            northern Italy, but also of Naples by the French. Again they came
            into direct conflict over Parma and Piacenza, Clement claiming
            them as a papal, the emperor claiming them as an imperial, fief.
            No pope since the time of Louis the Bavarian had issued the ban
            against a German emperor, and Clement ventured not to do so now.
            Refusing the invitation of Louis XIV. to go to Avignon, he was
            obliged either unconditionally to grant the German claims or to
            try the fortune of war. He chose the latter alternative. The
            miserable papal troops, however, were easily routed, and Clement
            was obliged, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1708, to
            acknowledge the emperor's brother, the Grand-duke Charles, as
            king of Spain, and generally to yield to Joseph's very moderate
            demands. Clement was the author of the constitution <span lang=

            "font-style: italic">Unigenitus</span></span>, which introduced
            the second stage in the history of Jansenism. After the short and

            well-meaning, narrow-minded man, ruled by a worthless favourite,
            Cardinal Coscia. He wished to canonize Gregory VII., in the fond
            hope of thereby securing new favour to his hierarchical views,
            but this was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page086">[pg

            protested against by almost all the courts. All the greater was
            the number of monkish saints with which he enriched the heavenly
            firmament. He promised to all who on their death-bed should say,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Blessed be Jesus Christ,”</span> a 2,000
            years' shortening of purgatorial pains. His successor <em class=

            the wretched Coscia of his offices, made him disgorge his
            robberies, imposed on him a severe fine and ten years'
            imprisonment, but afterwards resigned the management of
            everything to a greedy, grasping nephew. He was the first pope to
            condemn freemasonry, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            the noblest, most pious, learned, and liberal of the popes,
            zealous for the faith of his church, and yet patient with those
            who differed, moderate and wise in his political procedure, mild
            and just in his government, blameless in life. He had a special
            dislike of the Jesuits (§ 155, 12), and jestingly he declared,
            if, as the curialists assert, <span class="tei tei-q">“all law
            and all truth”</span> lie concealed in the shrine of his breast,
            he had not been able to find the key. He wrote largely on
            theology and canon law, founded seminaries for the training of
            the clergy, had many French and English works translated into
            Italian, and was a liberal patron of art. To check popular
            excesses he tried to reduce the number of festivals, but without
            success.—Continuation, in Paragraphs <a href=

            wealth, and attempts made by its abbots at reformation led only
            to endless quarrels and divisions. The abbots now squandered the
            revenues of their cloisters at court, and these institutions were
            allowed to fall into disorder and decay. When, in <span class=

            in France were suppressed, the city of Clugny bought the cloister
            and church for £4,000, and had them both pulled down.—The most
            important new orders were: (1) <em class=

            society for the religious and intellectual education of his
            countrymen; but when opposed by the Armenian patriarch, fled to
            the Morea and joined the United Armenians (§ 72, 2). In

            in Armenia and Armenian literature in the West. At a later time
            there was a famous Mechitarist college in Vienna, which did much

            America. The pope praised highly <span class="tei tei-q">“the

            only as a huntsman and a drinker, and by maintaining a mistress

            filled by others equally heroic. The first rank belongs to Anton

            1715; he died at Lausanne <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1760, where he had
            founded a theological seminary. He laboured unweariedly and
            successfully in gathering and organizing the scattered members of
            the Reformed church, and in overcoming fanaticism by imparting
            sound instruction. Paul Rabaut, his successor at Nismes, was from
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1780 to 1785 the
            faithful and capable leader of the martyr church. The judicial
            murder of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1762 presents a
            hideous example of the fanaticism of Catholic France. One of his
            sons had hanged himself in a fit of passion. When the report
            spread that it was the act of his father, in order to prevent the
            contemplated conversion of his son, the Dominicans canonized the
            suicide as a martyr to the Catholic faith, roused the mob, and
            got the Toulouse parliament to put the unhappy father to the
            torture of the wheel. The other sons were forced to abjure their
            faith, and the daughters were shut up in cloisters. Two years
            later Voltaire called attention to the atrocity, and so wrought
            on public opinion that on the revision of the proceedings by the
            Parisian parliament, the innocence of the ill-used family was
            clearly proved. Louis XV. paid them a sum of 30,000 livres; but
            the fanatical accusers, the false witnesses, and the corrupt
            judges were left unpunished. This incident improved the position
            of the Protestants, and in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            from the book, and induced the king to urge their express
            condemnation by the pope. In the <em class=

            Unigenitus</span></em> of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            pronounced these heretical, and the king required the expulsion
            from parliament and church of all who refused to adopt this bull,
            which caused a division of the French church into <em class=

            condemned propositions were quoted literally by Quesnel from
            Augustine and other Fathers, or were in exact agreement with
            biblical passages, Noailles and his party called for an
            explanation. Instead of this the pope threatened them with
            excommunication. In <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1717, four bishops,
            with solemn appeal to a general council, renounced the papal
            constitution as irreconcilable with the Catholic faith. They were
            soon joined by the Sorbonne and the universities of Rheims and
            Nantes, Archbishop Noailles, and more than twenty bishops, all
            the congregations of St. Maur and the Oratorians with large
            numbers of the secular clergy and the monks, especially of the
            Lazarists, Dominicans, Cistercians, and Camaldulensians. The
            pope, after vainly calling them to obey, thundered the ban
            against the Appellants in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1718. But the
            parliament took the matter up, and soon the aspect of affairs was
            completely changed. The regent's favourite, Dubois, hoping to
            obtain a cardinal's hat, took the side of the Acceptants and
            carried the duke with him, who got the parliament in 1720 to
            acknowledge the bull, with express reservation, however, of the
            Gallican liberties, and began a persecution of the Appellants.
            Under Louis XV. the persecution became more severe, although in
            many ways moderated by the influence of his former tutor,
            Cardinal Fleury. Noailles, who died in 1729, was obliged in 1728
            to submit unconditionally, and in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1730 the parliament
            formally ratified the bull. Amid daily increasing oppression,
            many of the more faithful Jansenists, mostly of the orders of St.
            Maur and the Oratory, fled to the Netherlands, where they gave
            way more and more to fanaticism. In 1727 a young <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page090">[pg 090]</span><a name="Pg090" id=
            "Pg090" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Jansenist priest, Francis of
            Paris, died with the original text of the appeal in his hands.
            His adherents honoured him as a saint, and numerous reports of
            miracles, which had been wrought at his grave in Medardus
            churchyard at Paris, made this a daily place of pilgrimage to
            thousands of fanatics. The excited enthusiasts, who fell into
            convulsions, and uttered prophecies about the overthrow of church
            and state, grew in numbers and, with that mesmeric power which
            fanaticism has been found in all ages to possess powerfully
            influenced many who had been before careless and profane. One of
            these was the member of parliament De Montgeron, who, from being
            a frivolous scoffer, suddenly, in 1732, fell into violent
            convulsions, and in a three-volumed work, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“<span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "fr"><span style="font-style: italic">La Vérité des Miracles
            Opérés par l'Intercession de François de
            Paris</span></span>,”</span> 1737, came forward as a zealous
            apologist of the party. The government, indeed, in 1732 ordered
            the churchyard to be closed, but portions of earth from the grave
            of the saint continued to effect convulsions and miracles.
            Thousands of convulsionists throughout France were thrown into
            prison, and in 1752, Archbishop Beaumont of Paris, with many
            other bishops, refused the last sacrament to those who could not
            prove that they had accepted the constitution. The grave of
            <span class="tei tei-q">“St. Francis,”</span> however, was the
            grave of Jansenism, for fanatical excess contains the seeds of
            dissolution and every manifestation of it hastens the
            catastrophe. Yet remnants of the party lingered on in France till
            the outbreak of the Revolution, of which they had prophesied.</p>

            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1592. The form of
            piety fostered by superior and inferior clergy in the Catholic
            church there, a heritage from the times of the Brethren of the
            Common Life (§ 112, 9), was directed to the deepening of
            Christian thought and feeling; and this, as well as the liberal
            attitude of the Archbishop of Utrecht, awakened the bitter
            opposition of the Jesuits. At the head of the local clergy was
            Sasbold Vosmeer, vicar-general of the vacant archiepiscopal see
            of Utrecht. Most energetically he set himself to thwart the
            Jesuit machinations, which aimed at abolishing the Utrecht see
            and putting the church of Holland under the jurisdiction of the
            papal nuncio at Cologne. On the ground of suspicions of secret
            conspiracy Vosmeer was banished. But his successors refused to be
            overruled or set aside by the Jesuits. Meanwhile in France the
            first stage of the Jansenist controversy had been passed through.
            The Dutch authorities had heartily welcomed the condemned book of
            their pious and learned countryman; but when the five
            propositions were denounced, they agreed in repudiating them,
            without, however, admitting that they had been taught in the
            sense objected to by Jansen. The Jesuits, therefore, charged them
            with the Jansenist heresy, and issued in <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page091">[pg 091]</span><a name="Pg091" id="Pg091" class=

            pamphlet full of lying insinuations about the origin and progress
            of Jansenism in Holland. Its beginning was traced back to a visit
            of Arnauld to Holland in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1681, and its
            effects were seen in the circulation of prayer-books, tracts, and
            sermons, urging diligent reading of Scripture, in the
            depreciation of the worship of Mary, of indulgences, of images of
            saints and relics, rosaries and scapularies (§ 188, 20),
            processions and fraternities, in the rigoristic strictness of the
            confessional, the use of the common language of the country in
            baptism, marriage, and extreme unction, etc. The archbishop of
            that time, Peter Codde, in order to isolate him, was decoyed to
            Rome, and there flattered with hypocritical pretensions of
            goodwill, while behind his back his deposition was carried out,
            and an apostolic vicar nominated for Utrecht in the person of his
            deadly foe Theodore de Cock. But the chapter refused him
            obedience, and the States of Holland forbad him to exercise any
            official function, and under threat of banishment of all Jesuits
            demanded the immediate return of the archbishop. Codde was now
            sent down with the papal blessing, but a formal decree of
            deposition followed him. Meanwhile the government pronounced on
            his rival De Cock, who avoided a trial for high treason by
            flight, a sentence of perpetual exile. But Codde, though
            persistently recognised by his chapter as the rightful
            archbishop, withheld on conscientious grounds from discharging
            official duties down to his death in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1710. Amid these
            disputes the Utrecht see remained vacant for thirteen years. The
            flock were without a chief shepherd, the inferior clergy without
            direction and support, the people were wrought upon by Jesuit
            emissaries, and the vacant pastorates were filled by the nuncio
            of Cologne. Thus it came about that of the 300,000 Catholics
            remaining after the Reformation, only a few thousands continued
            faithful to the national party, while the rest became bitter and
            extreme ultramontanes, as the Catholic church of Holland still
            is. Finally, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1723, the Utrecht
            chapter took courage and chose a new archbishop in the person of
            Cornelius Steenowen. Receiving no answer to their request for
            papal confirmation, the chapter, after waiting a year and a half,
            had him and also his three successors consecrated by a French
            missionary bishop, Varlet, who had been driven away by the
            Jesuits. But in order to prevent the threatened loss of
            legitimate consecration for future bishops after Varlet's death
            in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1742, a bishop
            elected at Utrecht was in that same year ordained to the chapter
            of Haarlem, and in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1758 the newly
            founded bishopric of Deventer was so supplied. All these, like
            all subsequent elections, were duly reported to Rome, and a
            strictly Catholic confession from electors and elected sent up;
            but each time, instead of confirmation, a frightful ban was
            thundered forth. This, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page092">[pg
            092]</span><a name="Pg092" id="Pg092" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            however, did not deter the Dutch government from formally
            recognising the elections.—Meanwhile the second and last act of
            the Jansenist tragedy had been played in France. Many of the
            persecuted Appellants sought refuge in Holland, and the welcome
            accorded them seemed to justify the long cherished suspicion of
            Jansenism against the people of Utrecht. They repelled these
            charges, however, by condemning the five propositions and the
            heresies of Quesnel's book; but they expressly refused the bull
            of Alexander VII. and its doctrine of papal infallibility. This
            put a stop to all attempts at reconciliation. The church of
            Utrecht meanwhile prospered. At a council held at Utrecht in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1765 it styled
            itself <span class="tei tei-q">“The Old Roman Catholic Church of
            the Netherlands,”</span> acknowledged the pope, although under
            his anathema, as the visible head of the Christian church,
            accepted the Tridentine decrees as their creed, and sent this
            with all the acts of council to Rome as proof of their orthodoxy.
            The Jesuits did all in their power to overturn the formidable
            impression which this at first made there; and they were
            successful. Clement XIII. declared the council null, and those
            who took part in it hardened sons of Belial. But their church at
            this day contains, under one archbishop and two bishops,
            twenty-six congregations, numbering 6,000 souls.<a id=

            with growing eagerness and success after worldly power, and
            instead of absolute devotion to the interests of the papacy,
            their chief aim was now the erection of an independent political
            and hierarchical dominion. Their love of rule had sustained its
            first check in the overthrow of the Jesuit state of Paraguay; but
            they had secured a great part of the world's trade (<a href=
            "#Section_156_Para_13" class="tei tei-ref">§ 156, 13</a>), and
            strove successfully to control European politics. The Jansenist
            controversy, however, had called forth against them much popular
            odium; Pascal had made them ridiculous to all men of culture, the
            other monkish orders were hostile to them, their success in trade
            roused the jealousy of other traders, and their interference in
            politics made enemies on every hand. The Portuguese government
            took the first decided step. A revolt in Paraguay and an attempt
            on the king's life were attributed to them and the minister
            Pombal, whose reforms they had opposed, had them banished from
            Portugal in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            by the Jesuits and under their influence, protected them by a
            bull; but Portugal refused to let the bull be proclaimed, led the
            papal nuncio over the frontier, broke off all relations with
            Rome, and sent whole shiploads of Jesuits to the <span class=

            Portugal's example when the general Ricci had answered the king's
            demand for a reform of his orders: <span lang="fr" class=

            For the enormous financial failure of the Jesuit La Valette, the
            whole order was made responsible, and at last, in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1764, banished from
            France as dangerous to the state. Spain, Naples, and Parma, too,
            soon seized all the Jesuits and transported them beyond the
            frontiers. The new papal election on the death of Clement XIII.
            was a life and death question with the Jesuits, but courtly
            influences and fears of a schism prevailed. The pious and liberal
            Minorite Ganganelli mounted the papal throne as <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Clement
            XIV.</span></em>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            with sweeping administrative reforms, forbad the reading of the
            bull <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=

            numbered 22,600 members and the pope felt, in granting the bull,
            that he endangered his own life. Next year he died, not without
            suspicion of poisoning. All the Catholic courts, even Austria,
            put the decree in force. But the heretic Frederick II. tolerated
            the order for a long time in Silesia, and Catherine II. and Paul
            I. in their Polish provinces.—<em class=

            of the exiled and imprisoned ex-Jesuits. After the outbreak of
            the French Revolution, a proposal was made at Rome, in

            greater moderation but complete success, effected a similar
            reform in the Jesuit-overrun Bavaria. Himself a strict Catholic,
            he asserted the supremacy of the state over a foreign hierarchy,
            and by reforming the churches, cloisters, and schools of his
            country he sought to improve their position. But under his
            successor, Charles Theodore, <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>
            1777-1799, everything was restored to its old
            condition.—Meanwhile a powerful voice was raised from the midst
            of the German prelates that aimed a direct blow at the
            hierarchical papal system. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            authority of general councils and the independence of bishops in
            opposition to the hierarchical pretensions of the popes. It was
            soon translated into German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and
            Italian. The book made a great impression, and Clement XIII.
            could do nothing against the bold defender of the liberties of
            the church. In <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            VI. had the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page094">[pg

            poor satisfaction of extorting a recantation from the old man of
            seventy-seven years, but he lived to see yet more deadly storms
            burst upon the church. Urged by Charles Theodore, Elector of
            Bavaria, the pope, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1785, had made
            Munich the residence of a nuncio. The episcopal electors of
            Mainz, Cologne, and Treves, and the Archbishop of Salzburg,
            seeing their archiepiscopal rights in danger, met in congress at
            Ems in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1786, and there, on
            the basis of the Febronian proofs, claimed, in the so called
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Punctation of Ems</span></em>, practical
            independence of the pope and the restoration of an independent
            German national Catholic church. But the German bishops found it
            easier to obey the distant pope than the near archbishops. So
            they united their opposition with that of the pope, and the
            undertaking of the archbishops came to nothing.—More threatening
            still for the existence of the hierarchy was the reign of
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Joseph
            II.</span></em> in Austria. German emperor from <span class=

            with his mother Maria Theresa, he began, immediately on his
            succession to sole rule in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1780, a radical
            reform of the whole ecclesiastical institutions throughout his
            hereditary possessions. In <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1781 he issued his
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Edict
            of Toleration</span></em>, by which, under various restrictions,
            the Protestants obtained civil rights and liberty of worship.
            Protestant places of worship were to have no bells or towers,
            were to pay stole dues to the Catholic priests, in mixed
            marriages the Catholic father had the right of educating all his
            children and the Catholic mother could claim the education at
            least of her daughters. By stopping all episcopal communications
            with the papal curia, and putting all papal bulls and
            ecclesiastical edicts under strict civil control, the Catholic
            church was emancipated from Roman influences, set under a native
            clergy, and made serviceable in the moral and religious training
            of the people, and all her institutions that did not serve this
            end were abolished. Of the 2,000 cloisters, 606 succumbed before
            this decree, and those that remained were completely sundered
            from all connexion with Rome. In vain the bishops and Pius VI.
            protested. The pope even went to Vienna in <span class=

            received with great respect, he could make nothing of the
            emperor. Joseph's procedure had been somewhat hasty and
            inconsiderate, and a reaction set in, led by interested parties,

            By numerous theological, ascetical, and philosophical tracts, but
            far more powerfully by his lectures and personal intercourse, he
            sowed the seeds of rationalism, which bore fruit in the teachings
            of many Catholic universities, and produced in the hearts of many
            pupils a warm and deep and at the same time a gentle and
            conciliatory Catholicism, which heartily greeted, even in pious
            Protestants, the foundations of a common faith and life. Compare

            Jesuits, Weishaupt imitated their methods, and so excited the

            was affected by the rationalistic movement. But that the power of
            the church to curse still survived was proved in the case of the
            Mainz professor, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Laurence Isenbiehl</span></em>, who applied
            the passage about Immanuel, in Isaiah vii. 14, not to the mother

            deposed in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            learned treatise on the same theme, he was put in prison. The
            pope too condemned his exposition as pestilential, and Isenbiehl

            but soon after died from the ill-treatment he had received. The
            rationalistic movement got hold more and more of the Catholic
            universities. In Mainz, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            course of centuries the church has often made mistakes. In the
            Austrian universities, under the protection of the Josephine
            edict, a whole series of Catholic theologians ventured to make
            cynically free criticisms, especially in the field of church
            history. At Bonn University, founded in <span class=

            lay his own head on the block.—At the Austrian universities,
            under the protection of the tolerant Josephine legislation, a
            whole series of Catholic theologians, Royko, Wolff, Dannenmayr,
            Michl, etc., criticised, often with cynical plainness, the
            proceedings and condition of the Catholic church. To this class
            also, in the first stage of his remarkably changeful and eventful
            career, belongs Ign. Aur. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Fessler</span></em>. From 1773, a Capuchin
            in various cloisters, last of all in Vienna, he brought down upon
            himself the bitter hatred of his order by making secret reports
            to the emperor about the ongoings that prevailed in these
            convents. He escaped their enmity by his appointment, in 1784, as
            professor of the oriental languages and the Old Testament at
            Lemberg, but was in 1787 dismissed from this office on account of
            various charges against his life, teaching, and poetical
            writings. In Silesia, in 1791, he went over to the Protestant
            church, joined the freemasons, held at Berlin the post of a
            councillor in ecclesiastical and educational affairs for the

            provinces of Poland, and, after losing this position in
            consequence of the events of the war of 1806, found employment in
            Russia in 1809; first, as professor of oriental languages at St.
            Petersburg, and afterwards, when opposed and persecuted there
            also on suspicion of entertaining atheistical views, as member of
            a legal commission in South Russia. Meanwhile having gradually
            moved from a deistical to a vague mystical standpoint, he was in
            1819 made superintendent and president of the evangelical
            consistory at Saratov, with the title of an evangelical bishop,
            and after the abolition of that office in 1833 he became general
            superintendent at St. Petersburg, where he died in 1839. His
            romances and tragedies as well as his theological and religious
            writings are now forgotten, but his <span class=

            living Christianity among Huguenots, mystics, and Jansenists, its
            prophets of the Cevennes and Jansenist convulsionists, etc.,
            called forth a spirit of freethinking to which Catholicism,
            Jansenism, and Protestantism appeared equally ridiculous and
            absurd. This movement was essentially different from English
            deism. The principle of the English movement was <em class=

            sense</span></em>, the universal moral consciousness in man, with
            the powerful weapon of rational criticism, maintaining the
            existence of an ideal and moral element in men, and holding by
            the more general principles of religion. French naturalism, on

            sort with scorn and wit. Yet there was an intimate relationship

            goods of the church. All cloisters were suppressed and their
            property sold. The number of bishops was reduced to one half, all
            ecclesiastical offices without a pastoral sphere were abolished,
            the clergy elected by the people paid by the state, and liberty
            of belief recognised as an inalienable right of man. The

            a schism. Some 40,000 priests who refused the oath mostly quitted

            Abrahamites were descended from the old Hussites, and professed
            to follow the faith of Abraham before his circumcision. Their
            fundamental doctrine was deistic monotheism, and of the Bible
            they accepted only the ten commandments and the Lord's Prayer.
            But as they would neither attend the Jewish synagogue nor the
            churches of any existing Christian sect, the emperor refused them
            religious toleration, drove them from their homes, and settled
            them in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            in Galicia, attached himself in Turkey, where he assumed the name
            of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Frank</span></em>, to the Jewish sect of the
            Sabbatarians, who, repudiating the Talmud, adopted the
            cabbalistic book Sohar as the source of their more profound
            religious teaching. Afterwards in Podolia, which was then still
            Polish, he was esteemed among his numerous adherents as a Messiah
            sent of God. Bitterly hated by the rabbinical Jews, and accused
            of indulging in vile orgies in their assemblies, many of those
            Soharists were thrown into prison at the instigation of Bishop
            Dembowski of Kaminetz. But when they turned and accused their
            opponents of most serious crimes against Christendom, and, at
            Frank's suggestion, pointing out what they alleged to be an
            identity between the book Sohar and the Christian doctrine of the
            Trinity and incarnation, made it known that they were inclined to
            become converts, they won the favour of the bishop. He arranged a
            disputation between the two parties, pronounced the Talmudists
            beaten, confiscated all available copies of the Talmud, dragged
            them through the streets tied to the tail of a horse, and then
            burnt them. Dembowski, however, died soon after in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1757, and the
            cathedral chapter expelled the Soharists from Kaminetz. They
            appealed to King Augustus III. and to Archbishop Lubienski of
            Lemberg, renewing their profession of faith in the Trinity, and
            promising to be subject to the pope. In a disputation with the
            Talmudists lasting three days they sought to prove that the
            Talmudists used Christian blood in their services, which
            afterwards led to the death of five of the Jews thus accused. By
            Frank's advice, who took part neither in this nor in the former
            disputation, but was the secret leader of the whole movement,
            they now formally applied for admission into the Catholic church,
            and their leader now entered Lemberg in great state. They
            actually submitted to be thus driven by him, and 1,000 of his
            adherents were baptized at Lemberg. Frank was baptized at Warsaw
            under the name of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Joseph</span></em>, the king himself acting
            as sponsor. In all Catholic journals this event was celebrated as
            a signal triumph for the Catholic church. But Frank among his own
            disciples continued to play the <span class=
            "tei tei-foreign"><span style=

            Messiah. Hence in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            Inquisition stepped in. Some of his followers were imprisoned,
            others banished, and he himself as a heresiarch condemned to
            confinement for life with hard labour, from which after thirteen
            years he was liberated on the first partition of Poland in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            favour of Catherine II., who employed him as secret political
            agent. Feeling that his life was insecure in Poland, he went to
            Moravia, and at Brünn reorganized his numerous and attached
            followers into a well-knit society, by which he was revered as
            the incarnation of the Deity, and his beautiful daughter Eva,

            with all the privileges attached to it, is an insoluble mystery.
            He now called himself Baron von Frank, formed with his followers
            from Moravia and Poland a brilliant establishment, which
            outwardly adhered to the Roman Catholic church, although he very
            seldom attended the Catholic services. Frank died in <span class=

            buried with great pomp, but without the presence of the Catholic
            clergy. His daughter Eva was able to maintain the extravagant
            establishment of her father for twenty-six years, when the debt
            resting on the castle reached three million florins. At last, in

            especially among the superior clergy, there crept in a Protestant
            tendency, which indeed held quite firmly by the old theology of
            the œcumenical synods of the Greek Church, but set aside or laid
            little stress upon later doctrinal developments. Even the
            celebrated and widely used catechism, drawn up originally for the
            use of the Grand-duke Paul Petrovich, by his tutor, the learned
            Platón, afterwards Metropolitan of Moscow, was not quite free
            from this tendency. It found yet more decided expression in the

            gnostics of the eighteenth, in which we find a blending of
            western ideas with the old oriental mysticism. Among those were
            the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            because, in spite of the orthodox prohibition, they used milk
            during the fasts. They rejected all anointings, even chrism and
            priestly consecration, and acknowledged only spiritual anointing
            by the doctrine of Christ. They also volatilized the idea of
            baptism and the Lord's supper into that of a merely spiritual
            cleansing and nourishing by the word of the gospel. Otherwise
            they led a quiet and honourable life. More important still in

            theological system of a speculative character, with a notable
            blending of theosophy, mysticism, Protestantism, and rationalism.
            They idealized the doctrine of the sacraments after the style of
            the Quakers, would have no special places of worship or an
            ordained clergy, refused to take oaths or engage in military
            service, and led peaceable and useful lives. They made their

            impulse was given to the pietist movement, and too often the
            whole German Church was embroiled in violent party strifes, in
            which both sides failed to keep the happy mean, and laid
            themselves open to the reproach of the adversaries. Spener died

            loss of these leaders the Halle pietism became more and more
            gross, narrow, unscientific, regardless of the Church confession,
            frequently renouncing definite beliefs for hazy pious feeling,
            and attaching undue importance to pious forms of expression and
            methodistical modes of life. The conventionalism encouraged by it
            became a very Pandora's box of sectarianism and fanaticism
            (<a href="#Section_170_Para_1" class="tei tei-ref">§ 170, 1</a>).
            But it had also set up a ferment in the church and in theology
            which created a wholesome influence for many years. More than
            6,000 theologians from all parts of Germany had down to Francke's
            death received their theological training in Halle, and carried
            the leaven of his spirit into as many churches and schools. A
            whole series of distinguished teachers of theology now rose in
            almost all the Lutheran churches of the German states, who,
            avoiding the onesidedness of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page105">[pg 105]</span><a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class=

            preached pure doctrine and a pious life. From Calixt they had
            learnt to be mild and fair towards the Reformed and Catholic
            churches, and by Spener they had been roused to a genuine and
            hearty piety. Gottfried Arnold's protest, onesided as it was, had
            taught them to discover, even among heretics and sectaries,
            partial and distorted truths; and from Calov and Löscher they had
            inherited a zeal for pure doctrine. Most eminent among these were
            Albert Bengel, of Württemberg, who died in <span class=

            flood of <span class="tei tei-q">“the Illumination”</span> came
            rushing in upon the German Lutheran Church about the middle of

            men.</p>

            condemned by the orthodox universities of Leipzig and Wittenberg,
            was protected and encouraged in Halle. The crowds of students
            flocking to this new seminary roused the wrath of the orthodox.
            The Wittenberg faculty, with Deutschmann at its head, issued a
            manifesto in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1695, charging
            Spener with no less than 264 errors in doctrine. Nor were those
            of Leipzig silent, Carpzov going so far as to style the mild and
            peace-loving Spener a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
            xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">procella
            ecclesiæ</span></span>. Other leading opponents of the pietists
            were Schelwig of Dantzig, Mayer of Wittenberg, and Fecht of
            Rostock. When Spener died in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>
            1705 his opponents gravely discussed whether he could be thought
            of as in glory. Fecht of Rostock denied that it could be. Among
            the later champions of pure doctrine the worthiest and ablest was
            the learned Löscher, superintendent at Dresden, <span class=

            Francis Buddeus of Jena for a long time sought ineffectually to
            bring about a reconciliation between Löscher and the pietists of
            Halle. In <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1710 Francke and
            Breithaupt obtained a valorous colleague in Joachim Lange; but
            even he was no match for Löscher in controversy. Meanwhile

            "Pg106" id="Pg106" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> pietism had more
            and more permeated the life of the people, and occasioned in many
            places violent popular tumults. In several states conventicles
            were forbidden; in others, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            they were allowed.</p>

            "Section_167_Para_2" id="Section_167_Para_2" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> 2. The orthodox regarded the pietists as a
            new sect, with dangerous errors that threatened the pure doctrine
            of the Lutheran Church; while the pietists maintained that they
            held by pure Lutheran orthodoxy, and only set aside its barren
            formalism and dead externalism for biblical practical
            Christianity. The controversy gathered round the doctrines of the
            new birth, justification, sanctification, the church, and the
            millennium. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">a</span></span>) The new birth. The orthodox
            maintained that regeneration takes place in baptism (§ 141, 13),
            every baptized person is regenerate; but the new birth needs
            nursing, nourishment, and growth, and, where these are wanting,
            reawakening. The pietists identified awakening or conversion with
            regeneration, considered that it was effected in later life
            through the word of God, mediated by a corporeal and spiritual
            penitential struggle, and a consequent spiritual experience, and
            sealed by a sensible assurance of God's favour in the believer's
            blessed consciousness. This inward sealing marks the beginning,
            introduction into the condition of babes in Christ. They
            distinguished a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "la"><span style="font-style: italic">theologia
            viatorum</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            doctrine, and a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "la"><span style="font-style: italic">theologia
            regenitorum</span></span>, which has to do with the soul's inner
            condition after the new birth. They have consequently been
            charged with maintaining that a true Christian who has arrived at
            the stage of spiritual manhood may and must in this life become
            free from sin.—(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">b</span></span>) Justification and
            Sanctification. In opposition to an only too prevalent
            externalizing of the doctrine of justification, Spener has taught
            that only living faith justifies, and if genuine must be
            operative, though not meritorious. Only in faith proved to be
            living by a pious life and active Christianity, but not in faith
            in the external and objective promises of God's word, lies the
            sure guarantee of justification obtained. His opponents therefore
            accused him of confounding justification and sanctification, and
            depreciating the former in favour of the latter. And, though not
            by Spener, yet by many of his followers, justification was put in
            the background, and in a onesided manner stress was laid upon
            practical Christianity. Spener and Francke had expressly preached
            against worldly dissipation and frivolity, and condemned dancing,
            the theatre, card-playing, as detrimental to the progress of
            sanctification, and therefore sinful; while the orthodox regarded
            them as matters of indifference. Besides this, the pietists held
            the doctrine of a day of grace, assigned to each one within the
            limit of his earthly life (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">terminism</span></em>).—(<span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>)
            The Church and the Pastorate. Orthodoxy regarded word and
            sacrament and the ministry which administered them as the basis
            and foundation of the church; pietism <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page107">[pg 107]</span><a name="Pg107" id="Pg107" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> held that the individual believers
            determined the character and existence of the church. In the one
            case the church was thought to beget, nurse, and nourish
            believers; in the other believers, constituted, maintained, and
            renewed the church, accomplishing this best by conventicles, in
            which living Christianity preserved itself and diffused its
            influence abroad. The orthodox laid great stress upon clerical
            ordination and the grace of office; pietists on the person and
            his faith. Spener had taught that only he who has experienced in
            his own heart the power of the gospel, <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>
            he who has been born again, can be a true preacher and pastor.
            Löscher maintained that the official acts of an unconverted
            preacher, if only he be orthodox, may be blessed as well as those
            of a converted man, because saving power lies not in the person
            of the preacher, but in the word of God which he preaches, in its
            purity and simplicity, and in the sacraments which he dispenses
            in accordance with their institution. The pietists then went so
            far as absolutely to deny that saving results could follow the
            preaching of an unconverted man. The proclamation of forgiveness
            by the church without the inward sealing had for them no meaning;
            yea, they regarded it as dangerous, because it quieted conscience
            and made sinners secure. Hence they keenly opposed private
            confession and churchly absolution. Of a special grace of office
            they would know nothing: the true ordination is the new birth;
            each regenerate one, and such a one only, is a true priest. The
            orthodox insisted above all on pure doctrine and the church
            confession; the pietists too regarded this as necessary, but not
            as the main thing. Spener decidedly maintained the duty of
            accepting the church symbols; but later pietists rejected them as
            man's work, and so containing errors. Among the orthodox, again,
            some went so far as to claim for their symbols absolute immunity
            from error. Spener's opposition to the compulsory use of fixed
            Scripture portions, prescribed forms of prayer, and the exorcism
            formulary occasioned the most violent contentions. On the other
            hand, his reintroduction of the confirmation service before the
            first communion, which had fallen into general desuetude, was
            imitated, and soon widely prevailed, even among the
            orthodox.—(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">d</span></span>) Eschatology. Spener had
            interpreted the biblical doctrine of the 1,000 years' reign as
            meaning that, after the overthrow of the papacy and the
            conversion of heathens and Jews, a period of the most glorious
            and undisturbed tranquillity would dawn for the kingdom of Christ
            on earth as prelude to the eternal sabbath. His opponents
            denounced this as chiliasm and fanaticism.—(<span class=

            There was, finally, a controversy about Divine providence
            occasioned by the founding of Francke's orphan house at Halle.
            The pietists pointed to the establishment and growth of this
            institution as an instance of immediate divine providence; while
            Löscher, by indicating the common means employed to <span class=

            whole affair to the domain of general and daily providence,
            without denying the value of the strong faith in God and the
            active love that characterized its founder, as well as the
            importance of the Divine blessing which rested upon the

            out of the application of the mathematical method of

            attached himself to the philosophical system of Leibnitz, and
            sought to unite philosophy and Christianity; but under the
            manipulation of his logico-mathematical method of proof he took
            all vitality out of the system, and the pre-established harmony
            of the world became a purely mechanical clockwork. He looked
            merely to the logical accuracy of Christian truths, without
            seeking to penetrate their inner meaning, gave formal exercise to
            the understanding, while the heart was left empty and cold; and
            thus inevitably revelation and mystery made way for a mere
            natural theology. Hence the charge brought against the system of
            tending to fatalism and atheism, not only by narrow pietists like
            Lange, but by able and liberal theologians like Buddeus and
            Crusius, was quite justifiable. By a cabinet order of Frederick
            William I. in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1723 Wolff was
            deposed, and ordered within two days, on pain of death, to quit
            the Prussian states. But so soon as Frederick II. ascended the
            throne, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            the philosopher to Halle from Marburg, where he had meanwhile
            taught with great success.<a id="noteref_56" name="noteref_56"

            to introduce Wolff's method into theology. In respect of contents
            his theology occupies essentially the old orthodox ground. The

            regarded a union between the Lutheran and Reformed churches on
            their common beliefs, which in importance far exceeded the points
            of difference, as both practicable and desirable; and in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            His proposal, however, found little favour among Lutheran
            theologians. Not only Cyprian of Gotha, but even such
            conciliatory theologians as Weismann of Tübingen and Mosheim of
            Helmstädt, opposed it. But forty years later a Lutheran
            theologian, Heumann of Göttingen, demonstrated that <span class=

            and proposed, in order to end the schism, that Lutherans should
            drop their doctrine of the supper and the Reformed their doctrine
            of predestination. This pamphlet, edited after the author's death
            by Sack of Berlin, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1764, produced a
            great sensation, and called forth a multitude of replies on the
            Lutheran side, the best of which were those of Walch of Jena and

            found considerable favour.</p>

            "font-style: italic">Theories of Ecclesiastical
            Law.</span></em>—Of necessity during the first century of the
            Protestant church its government was placed in the hands of the
            princes, who, because there were no others to do so, dispensed
            the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=

            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">præcipua membra ecclesiæ</span></span>. What
            was allowed at first in the exigency of these times came
            gradually to be regarded as a legal right. Orthodox theology and
            the juristic system associated with it, especially that of
            Carpzov, justified this assumption in what is called the
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">episcopal system</span></em>. This theory
            firmly maintains the mediæval distinction between the spiritual
            and civil powers as two independent spheres ordained of God; but
            it installs the prince as <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
            xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">summus
            episcopus</span></span>, combining in his person the highest
            spiritual with the highest civil authority. In lands, however,
            where more than one confession held sway, or where a prince
            belonging to a different section of the church succeeded, the
            practical difficulties of this theory became very apparent; as,
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>, when a Reformed or
            Romish prince had to be regarded as <span lang="la" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">summus episcopus</span></span> of a Lutheran
            church. Driven thus to seek another basis for the claims of royal
            supremacy, a new theory, that of the <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">territorial
            system</span></em>, was devised, according to which the prince
            possessed highest ecclesiastical authority, not as <span lang=
            "la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">præcipuum membrum ecclesiæ</span></span>,
            but as sovereign ruler in the state. The headship of the church
            was therefore not an independent prerogative over and above that
            of civil government, but an inherent element in it: <span lang=

            "font-style: italic">cujus regio, illius et
            religio</span></span>. The historical development of the German
            Reformation gave support to this theory (§ 126, 6), as seen in
            the proceedings of the Diet of Spires in <span class=

            preferred the Calvinistic presbyterial constitution, because only
            in it could equality be given to all the three orders,
            <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=

            systems was certainly not without influence upon the construction
            of a third theory, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            this scheme there belonged to the sovereign as such only the

            members. The normal constitution therefore required the
            collective vote of all the members through their synods. But
            outward circumstances during the Reformation age had necessitated
            the relegating the discharge of these collegial rights to the
            princes, which in itself was not unallowable, if only the
            position be maintained that the prince acts <span lang="la"

            obligation to render an account to those who have commissioned
            him. This system, on account of its democratic character, found
            hearty supporters among the later rationalists. But as a matter
            of fact nowhere was any of the three systems consistently carried
            out. The constitution adopted in most of the national churches
            was a weak vacillation between all the three.<a id="noteref_57"

            during the first half of the century, many valuable
            contributions. Two main groups of singers may be distinguished:
            (1) The pietistic school, characterized by a biblical and
            practical tendency. The spiritual life of believers, the work of
            grace in conversion, growth in holiness, the varying conditions
            and experiences of the religious life, were favourite themes.
            They were fitted, not so much for use in the public services, as
            for private devotion, and few comparatively have been retained in
            collections of church hymns. The later productions of this school
            sank more and more into sentimentalism and allegorical and
            fanciful play of words. We may distinguish among the Halle
            pietists an older school, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1690-1720, and a

            former, coloured by the fervent piety of Francke, produced
            simple, hearty, and often profound songs. The most distinguished

            Literature.</span></em>—Pietism led to a powerful revival of
            religious life among the people, which it sustained by zealous
            preaching and the publication of devotional works. A similar
            activity displayed itself among the orthodox. Francke began his
            charitable labours with seven florins; but with undaunted faith
            he started his Orphanage, writing over its door the words of
            Isaiah xl. 31. In faith and benevolence Woltersdorff was a worthy
            successor of Francke; and Baron von Canstein applied his whole
            means to the founding of the Bible Institute of Halle. Missions
            too were now prosecuted with a zeal and success which witnessed
            to the new life that had arisen in the Lutheran church.—A
            remarkable manifestation of the pietistic spirit of this age is
            seen in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">The Praying Children in Silesia</span></em>,
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            four years old and upward gathered in open fields for singing and
            prayer, and called for the restoration of churches taken away by
            the Catholics. The movement spread over the whole land. In vain
            was it denounced from the pulpits and forbidden by the
            authorities. Opposition only excited more and more the zeal of
            the children. At last the churches were opened for their
            services. The excitement then gradually subsided. It was,
            however, long a subject of discussion between the pietists and
            the orthodox; the latter denouncing it as the work of the devil,
            the former regarding it as a wonderful awakening of God's
            grace.—Best remembered of the many devotional writers of this
            period are Bogatsky of Halle, died <span class=

            quickening of religious life by pietism bore fruit in new
            missionary activity. Frederick IV. of Denmark founded in his East
            Indian possessions the Tranquebar mission in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1706, under
            Ziegenbalg and Plutschau. Ziegenbalg, who translated the New
            Testament into Tamil, died in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1719. From the
            Danish possessions this mission carried its work over into the
            English Indian territories. Able and zealous workers were sent
            out from the Halle Institute, of whom the greatest was Chr. Fr.
            Schwartz, who died in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1798, after nearly
            fifty years of noble service in the mission field. In the last
            quarter of the century, however, under the influence of
            rationalism, zeal for missions declined, the Halle society broke
            up, and the English were allowed to reap the harvest sown by the
            Lutherans. The Halle professor Callenberg founded in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1728 a society for
            the conversion of the Jews, in the interests of which Stephen
            Schultz travelled over Europe, Asia, and Africa, preaching the
            Cross among the Jews. Christianity had been introduced among the
            Eskimos in Greenland in the eleventh century (§ 93, 5), but the
            Scandinavian colony there had been forgotten, and no trace of the
            religion which it had taught any longer remained. This reproach
            to Christianity lay sore on the heart of Hans Egede, a Norwegian
            pastor, and he found no rest till, supported by a
            Danish-Norwegian trading house, he sailed with his family in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1721 for these
            frozen and inhospitable shores. Amid almost inconceivable
            hardships, and with at first but little success, he continued to
            labour unweariedly, and even after the trading company abandoned
            the field he remained. In <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1733 he had the
            unexpected joy of welcoming three Moravian missionaries,
            Christian David and the brothers Stach. His joy was too soon
            dashed by the spiritual pride of the new arrivals, who insisted
            on modelling everything after their own Moravian principles, and
            separated themselves from the noble Egede, when he refused to
            yield, as an unspiritual and unconverted man. Egede, on the other
            hand, though deeply offended at their confounding justification
            and sanctification, their contempt of pure doctrine, and their
            unscriptural views and mode of speech, was ready to attribute all
            this to their defective theological training. He rewarded their
            unkindness, when they were stricken down in sore sickness, with
            unwearied, loving care. In <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1736 he returned to
            Denmark, leaving his son Paul to carry on his work, and continued
            director of the Greenland Mission Seminary in Copenhagen till his
            death in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The highly
            gifted Count Zinzendorf, inspired even as a boy, out of fervent
            love to the Saviour, with the idea of gathering together the
            lovers of Jesus, took occasion of the visit of some Moravian
            Exultants to his estate to realize his cherished project. On the
            Hutberg he dropped the mustard seed of the dream of his youth
            into fertile soil, where, under his fervent care, it soon grew
            into a stately tree, whose branches spread over all European
            lands, and thence through all parts of the habitable globe. The
            society which he founded was called <span class="tei tei-q">“The
            Society of the United Brethren.”</span> The fact that this
            society was not overwhelmed by the extravagances to which for a
            time it gave way, that its fraternising with the fanatics, the
            extravagant talk in which its members indulged about a special
            covenant with the Saviour, and their not over-modest claims to a
            peculiar rank in the kingdom of God, did not lead to its utter
            overthrow in the abyss of fanaticism, and that on the slippery
            paths of its mystical marriage theory it was able to keep its
            feet, presents a phenomenon, which stands alone in church
            history, and more than anything else proves how deeply rooted
            founder and followers were in the saving truths of the gospel.
            The count himself laid aside many of his extravagances, and what
            still remained was abandoned by his sensible and prudent
            successor Spangenberg, so far as it was not necessarily involved
            in the fundamental idea of a special covenant with the Saviour.
            The special service rendered by the society was the protest which
            it raised against the generally prevailing apostasy. During this
            period of declension it saved the faith of many <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a name="Pg116" id=
            "Pg116" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> pious souls, affording them a
            welcome refuge, with rich spiritual nourishment and nurture. With
            the reawakening of the religious life in the nineteenth century,
            however, its adherents lost ground in Europe more and more, by
            maintaining their old onesidedness in life and doctrine, their
            depreciatory estimate of theological science, and the quarrelsome
            spirit which they generally manifested. But in one province, that
            of missions to the heathen, their energy and success have never
            yet been equalled. Their thorough and well-organized system of
            education also deserves particular mention. At present the
            Society of the Brethren numbers half a million, distributed among
            100 settlements or thereabout.</p>

            born in Dresden in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1700. Spener was
            one of his sponsors at baptism. His father dying early, and his
            mother marrying a second time, the boy, richly endowed with gifts
            of head and heart, was brought up by his godly pietistic
            grandmother, the Baroness von Gersdorf. There in his earliest
            youth he learned to seek his happiness in the closest personal
            fellowship with the Lord, and the tendency of his whole future
            life to yield to the impulses of pious feeling already began to
            assert itself. In his tenth year he entered the Halle Institute
            under Francke, where the pietistic idea of the need of the
            <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "la"><span style="font-style: italic">ecclesiolæ in
            ecclesia</span></span> took firm possession of his heart. Even in
            his fifteenth year he sought its realization by founding among
            his fellow students <span class="tei tei-q">“The Order of the
            Grain of Mustard Seed”</span> (Matt. xiii. 31). After completing
            his school course, his uncle and guardian, in order to put an end
            to his pietistic extravagances, sent him to study law at the
            orthodox University of Wittenberg. Here he had at first to suffer
            a sort of martyrdom as a rigid pietist swimming against the
            orthodox current. His residence at Wittenberg, however, was
            beneficial to him in freeing him unconsciously of the Halle
            pietism, which had restrained his spiritual development. He did
            indeed firmly maintain the fundamental idea of pietism,
            <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "la"><span style="font-style: italic">ecclesiolæ in
            ecclesia</span></span>, but in his mind it gained a wider
            significance than pietism had given it. His endeavours to secure
            a personal conference, and where possible a union, between the
            Halle and Wittenberg leaders were unsuccessful. In <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1719 he left
            Wittenberg and travelled for two years, visiting the most
            distinguished representatives of all confessions and sects. This
            too fostered his idea of a grand gathering of all who love the
            Lord Jesus. On his return home, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1721, at the wish
            of his relatives he entered the service of the Saxon government.
            But a religious genius like Zinzendorf could find no satisfaction
            in such employment. And soon an opportunity presented itself for
            carrying out the plan to which his thoughts and longings were
            directed.<a id="noteref_62" name="noteref_62" href=

            Schmalcald, and still more the Thirty Years' War, had brought
            frightful suffering and persecution upon the Bohemian and
            Moravian Brethren. Many of them sought refuge in Poland and
            Prussia. One of the refugees was the famous educationist J. Amos
            Comenius, who died in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1671, after having
            been bishop of the Moravians at Lissa in Posen from 1648. Those
            who remained behind were, even after the Peace of Westphalia,
            subjected to the cruellest oppression! Only secretly in their
            houses and at the risk of their lives could they worship God
            according to the faith of their fathers; and they were obliged
            publicly to profess their adherence to the Romish church. Thus
            gradually the light of the gospel was extinguished in the homes
            of their descendants, and only a tradition, becoming ever more
            and more faint, remained as a memory of their ancestral faith. A
            Moravian carpenter, Christian David, born and reared in the
            Romish church, but converted by evangelical preaching, succeeded
            in the beginning of the eighteenth century in fanning into a
            flame again in some families the light that had been quenched.
            This little band of believers, under David's leading, went forth
            in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1722 and sought
            refuge on Zinzendorf's estate in Lusatia. The count was then
            absent, but the steward, with the hearty concurrence of the
            count's grandmother, gave them the Hutberg at Berthelsdorf as a
            settlement. With the words of Psalm lxxxiv. 4 on his lips,
            Christian David struck the axe into the tree for building the
            first house. Soon the little town of Herrnhut had arisen, as the
            centre of that Christian society which Zinzendorf now sought with
            all his heart and strength to develop and promote. Gradually
            other Moravians dropped in, but a yet greater number from far and
            near streamed in, of all sorts of religious revivalists,
            pietists, separatists, followers of Schwenckfeld, etc. Zinzendorf
            had no thought of separation from the Lutheran church. The
            settlers were therefore put under the pastoral care of Rothe, the
            worthy pastor of Berthelsdorf (§ 166, 6). To organize such a
            mixed multitude was no easy task. Only Zinzendorf's glorious
            enthusiasm for the idea of a congregation of saints, his eminent
            organizing talents, the wonderful elasticity and tenacity of his
            will, the extraordinary prudence, circumspection, and wisdom of
            his management, made it possible to cement the incongruous
            elements and avoid an open breach. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page118">[pg 118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> The Moravians insisted upon restoring their
            old constitution and discipline, and of the others, each wished
            to have prominence given to whatever he thought specially
            important. Only on one point were they all agreed, the duty of
            refusing to conform to the Lutheran church and its pastor Rothe.
            The count, therefore, felt obliged to form a new and separatist
            society. Personally he had no special liking for the old Moravian
            constitution; but the lot decided in its favour, while the idea
            of continuing a pre-Reformation martyr church was not without a
            certain charm. Thus Zinzendorf drew up a constitution with old
            Moravian forms and names, on the basis of which the colony was
            established, August 13th, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            great energy the new society proceeded to found settlements in
            Germany, Holland, England, Ireland, Denmark, Norway, and North
            America, as well as among German residents in other lands. In
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1734, Zinzendorf
            submitted to examination at Tübingen as candidate for license,
            and in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1737 received
            episcopal consecration from the Berlin court preacher, Jablonsky,
            who was at the same time bishop of the Moravian Brethren, which
            the same prelate had two years previously granted to Dr.
            Nitschmann, another member of the society. The efforts of the
            Brethren to spread their cause now attracted attention. The Saxon
            government in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1736 sent to
            Herrnhut a commission, of which Löscher was a member. But in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1736, before it
            submitted its report, which on the whole was favourable,
            Zinzendorf quitted the country, probably by the elector's command
            at the instigation of the Austrian government, which objected to
            the harbouring of so many Bohemian and Moravian emigrants. Like
            all those at this time persecuted on account of religion he took
            refuge in Wetterau (<a href="#Section_170_Para_2" class=
            "tei tei-ref">§ 170, 2</a>). With his little family of pilgrims
            he settled at Ronneburg near Büdingen, founded the prosperous
            churches of Marienborn and Herrnhaag, and travelled extensively
            in Europe and America. This period of exile was the period when
            the society was most successful in spreading outwardly, but it
            was also the period when it suffered most from troubles and
            dissensions within. It was bitterly attacked by Lutheran
            theologians, and much more venomously by apostates from its own
            fold. The Brethren at this time afforded only too much ground for
            misunderstanding and reproach. To this period belongs the famous
            fiction of a special covenant, the Pandora-box of all other
            absurdities; the development of the count's own theological views
            and peculiar form of expression in his numerous works; the
            composition and introduction of unsavoury spiritual songs, with
            their silly conceits and many blasphemous and even obscene
            pictures and analogies; the market-crier <span class="tei tei-pb"

            pure methods of propaganda, the introduction of a marriage
            discipline fitted to break down all modest restraints; and,
            finally, the so-called <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign"
            xml:lang="de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Niedlichkeiten</span></span>, or boisterous
            festivals. Even the pietists opposed these antinomian excesses.
            Tersteegen, too (<a href="#Section_169_Para_1" class=
            "tei tei-ref">§ 169, 1</a>), whose mystic tendency inclined him
            strongly toward pietist views, reproached the Herrnhuters with
            frivolity. This polemic, disagreeable as it was, exercised a
            wholesome influence upon the society. The count became more
            guarded in his language, and more prudent in his behaviour, while
            he set aside the most objectionable excrescences of doctrine and
            practice that had begun to show themselves in the community. At
            last, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1747, the Saxon
            government repeated the edict of banishment so far as the person
            of the founder was concerned, and when, two years later, the
            society expressly accepted the Augsburg Confession, it was
            formally recognised in Saxony. In this same year, <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1749, an English
            act of parliament recognised it as a church with a pure episcopal
            succession on equal terms with the Anglican episcopal
            church.—Zinzendorf continued down to his death to direct the
            affairs of this church, which hung upon him with childlike
            affection, reflecting his personality, not only in its
            excellences, but also in all its extravagances. He died in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1760 in the full
            enjoyment of that blessedness which his fervent love for the
            Saviour had brought him.</p>

            "font-style: italic">Zinzendorf's Plan and
            Work.</span></em>—While Zinzendorf received his first impulse
            from pietism, he soon perceived its onesidedness and narrowness.
            He would have no conventicle, but one organized community; no
            ideal invisible, but a real visible church; no narrow methodism,
            but a rich, free administration of the Christian spirit. He did
            not, in the first instance, aim at the conversion of the world,
            nor even at the reformation of the church, but at gathering and
            preserving those belonging to the Saviour. He hoped, however, to
            erect a reservoir in which he might collect every little brooklet
            of living water, from which he might again water the whole world.
            And when he succeeded in organizing a community, he was quite
            convinced that it was the Philadelphia of the Apocalypse (iii. 7
            ff.), that it introduced <span class="tei tei-q">“the
            Philadelphian period”</span> of church history, of which all
            prophets and apostles had prophesied. His plan had originally
            reference to all Christendom, and he even took a step toward
            realizing this universal idea. In order to build a bridge between
            the Catholic church and his own community, he issued, in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1727, a
            Christo-Catholic hymn-book and prayer-book, and had even sketched
            out a letter to the pope to accompany a copy of his book. He also
            attempted, by a letter to the patriarchs and then to Elizabeth,
            empress of Russia, to interest the Greek church in his scheme,
            dwelling upon the Greek extraction of the church of the Moravian
            Brethren (§ 79, 2). His gathering of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page120">[pg 120]</span><a name="Pg120" id="Pg120" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> members, however, was practically limited
            to the Protestant churches. All confessions and sects afforded
            him contingents. He was himself heartily attached to the
            distinctive doctrines of the Lutheran church. But in a society
            whose distinctive characteristic it was to be the gathering point
            for the pious of all nationalities, doctrine and confession could
            not be the uniting bond. It could be only a fellowship of love
            and not of creed, and the bond a community of loving sentiment
            and loving deeds. The inmost principle of Lutheranism,
            reconciliation by the blood of Christ, was saved, indeed was made
            the characteristic and vital doctrine, the one point of union
            between Moravians, Lutherans, and Reformed. Over the three
            parties stood the count himself as <span lang="la" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">ordinarius</span></span>; but this gave an
            external and not a confessional unity. The subsequent acceptance
            of the Augsburg Confession, in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1749, was a
            political act, so as to receive a civil status, and had otherwise
            no influence. Instead then of the confession, Zinzendorf made the
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">constitution</span></em> the bond of union.
            Its forms were borrowed from the old Moravian church order, but
            dominated and inspired by Zinzendorf's own spirit. The old
            Moravian constitution was episcopal and clerical, and proceeded
            from the idea of the church; while the new constitution of
            Herrnhut was essentially presbyterial, and proceeded from the
            idea of the community, and that as a communion of saints. The
            Herrnhut bishops were only titular bishops; they had no diocese,
            no jurisdiction, no power of excommunication. All these
            prerogatives belonged to the united eldership, in which the lay
            element was distinctly predominant. Herrnhut had no pastors, but
            only preaching brothers; the pastoral care devolved upon the
            elders and their assistants. But beside these half-Lutheran and
            pseudo-Moravian peculiarities, there was also a Donatist element
            at the basis of the constitution. This lay in the fundamental
            idea of absolutely true and pure children of God, and reached
            full expression in the concluding of a <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">special
            covenant</span></em> with the Saviour at London on Sept. 16th,
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            for some years administered the office of an elder-general. But
            at the London synod it was declared that he had not the requisite
            gifts for that office. Dober now wished to resign. While in
            confusion as to whom they could appoint, it flashed into the
            minds of all to appoint the Saviour Himself. <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Our feeling and heart conviction was, that He made a
            special covenant with His little flock, taking us as His peculiar
            treasure, watching over us in a special way, personally
            interesting Himself in every member of our community, and doing
            that for us perfectly which our previous elders could only do
            imperfectly.”</span></p>

            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">numerous
            extravagances</span></em> which Zinzendorf countenanced for a
            time, the following may be mentioned. (1) The notion of the
            motherhood of the Holy Spirit. Zinzendorf described the holy
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page121">[pg 121]</span><a name=
            "Pg121" id="Pg121" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Trinity as
            <span class="tei tei-q">“man, woman, and child.”</span> The
            Spirit is the mother in three respects: the eternal generation of
            the Son of God, the conception of the Man Jesus, and the second
            birth of believers. (2) The notion of the fatherhood of Jesus
            Christ (Isa. ix. 6). Creation is ascribed solely to the Son,
            hence Christ is our special, direct Father. The Father of our
            Lord Jesus Christ is only, <span class="tei tei-q">“in the
            language of men, our father-in-law or grandfather.”</span> (3) In
            reference to our Lord's life on earth, Zinzendorf delighted in
            using terms of contempt, in order to emphasize the depths of His
            humiliation. (4) In like manner he uses reproachful terms in
            speaking of the style of the sacred Scriptures, and the inspired
            community prefers a living Bible. (5) The theory and practice of
            mystical marriage, according to Ephesians v. 32. The community
            and each member of it are spiritual brides of Christ, and the
            marriage relation and begetting of children were set forth and
            spiritualized in a singularly indelicate manner.</p>

            "font-style: italic">Zinzendorf's greatness</span></em> lay in
            the fervency of his love of the Saviour, and in the yearning
            desire to gather under the shadow of the cross all who loved the
            Lord. His weakness consisted not so much in his manifested
            extravagances, as in his idea that he had been called to found a
            society. To the realizing of this idea he gave his life, talents,
            heart, and means. The advantages of rank and culture he also gave
            to this one task. He was personally convinced of his Divine call,
            and as he did not recognise the authority of the written word,
            but only subjective impressions, it is easily seen how he would
            drift into absurdities and inconsistencies. The end contemplated
            seemed to him supremely important, so that to realize it he did
            not scruple to depart from strict truthfulness.—Zinzendorf's
            writings, over one hundred in number, are characterized by
            originality, brilliancy, and peculiar forms of expression. Of his
            2,000 hymns, mostly improvised for public services, 700 of the
            best were revised and published by Knapp. Two are still found in
            most collections, and are more or less reproduced in our English
            hymns, <span class="tei tei-q">“Jesus still lead on,”</span> and
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Jesus, Thy blood and
            righteousness.”</span></p>

            Spangenberg</span></em>, who died <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1792. Born in 1704,
            he became personally acquainted with Zinzendorf in 1727, after he
            had completed his studies at Jena under Buddæus, and continued
            ever after on terms of close intimacy with him and his community.
            Through the good offices of G. A. Francke, son and successor of
            A. H. Francke, he was called in Sept., 1732, to the office of an
            assistantship in the theological faculty at Halle, and appointed
            school inspector of the Orphanage; but very soon offence was
            taken at the brotherly fellowship which he had, not only with the
            society of Herrnhut, but also <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page122">[pg 122]</span><a name="Pg122" id="Pg122" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> with other separatists. The
            misunderstanding that thus arose led in April, 1733, to his
            deprivation under a royal cabinet order, and his expulsion by
            military power from Halle. He now formally joined the communion
            of the Brethren. The first half of his signally blessed ministry
            of sixty years among the Moravians was chiefly devoted to foreign
            mission work, both in their colonies abroad and in their stations
            in heathen lands. In Holland in 1734, in England and Denmark in
            1735, he obtained official permission for the founding of
            Moravian colonies in Surinam, in the American state of Georgia,
            and in Santa Cruz, the forming and management of which he himself
            undertook, besides directing the mission work in these places.
            Returning from America in 1762, he won, after Zinzendorf's death,
            so complete an ascendency in the church in every respect, that he
            may well be regarded as its second founder. At the Synod of
            Marienborn, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1764, the
            constitution was revised and perfected. Zinzendorf's monarchical
            prerogative was surrendered to the eldership, and Spangenberg
            prudently secured the withdrawal of all excrescences and
            extravagances. But the central idea of a special covenant was not
            touched, and Sept. 16th is still held as a grand pentecost
            festival. In the fifth section of the statutes of the United
            Brethren at Gnaden, 1819, it distinguishes itself from all the
            churches as a <span class="tei tei-q">“society of true children
            of God; as a family of God, with Jesus as its head.”</span> In
            the fourth section of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Historical
            Account of the Constitution of the United Brethren at Gnaden,
            1823,”</span> the society is described as <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“a company of living members of the invisible body of
            Jesus Christ”</span>; and in its litany for Easter morning, it
            adds as a fourth particular to the article of the creed:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I believe that our brothers <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">N.
            N.</span></em>, and our sisters <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">N. N.</span></em>
            have joined the church above, and have entered into the joy of
            the Lord.”</span> The synod of <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1848 modified this
            article, and generally the society's distinctive views are not
            made so prominent. This liberal tendency had dogmatic expression
            given to it in Spangenberg's <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang=
            "la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Idea Fidei Fratrum</span></span>.”</span>
            Only a few new settlements have been formed since Zinzendorf's
            death, and none of any importance; while the hitherto flourishing
            Moravian settlements in Wetterau were destroyed and their members
            banished, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            in the expulsion of the Herrnhuters, these regions proved in the
            second half of the century a more fruitful field than any other.
            They secured there a relation to the national church such as they
            never attained unto elsewhere. They had in these parts formally
            organized a church within the church, whose members, mostly
            peasants, felt convinced that they <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            His chosen little flock, a proceeding which caused infinite
            trouble, especially in Livonia, to the faithful pastors, who
            perceived the deadly mischief that was being wrought, and
            witnessed against them from God's word. This protest was too
            powerful and convincing to be disregarded, and now, not only too
            late, but also in too half-hearted a way, Herrnhut began, in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">The doctrinal
            peculiarities of the Brotherhood</span></em> cannot be quite
            correctly described as un-Lutheran, or anti-Lutheran. Bengel
            smartly characterized them in a single phrase: <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“They plucked up the stock of sound doctrine,
            stripped oft what was most essential and vital, and retained the
            half of it,”</span> which not only then, but even still retains
            its truth and worth. Salvation is regarded as proceeding purely
            from the Son, the God-Man, so that the relation of the Father and
            of the Holy Spirit to redemption is scarcely even nominal; and
            the redemption of the God-Man again is viewed one-sidedly as
            consisting only in His sufferings and death, while the other
            side, that is grounded on His life and resurrection, is either
            carefully passed over, or its fruit is represented as borrowed
            from the atoning death. Thus not only justification, but
            sanctification is derived exclusively from the death of Christ,
            and this, not so much as a forensic substitutionary satisfaction,
            although that is not expressly denied, but rather as a Divine
            love-sacrifice which awakens an answering love in us. The whole
            of redemption is viewed as issuing from Christ's blood and
            wounds; and since from this mode of viewing the subject God's
            grace and love are made prominent rather than His righteousness,
            we hear almost exclusively of the gospel, and little or nothing
            of the law. All preaching and teaching were avowedly directed to
            the awakening of pious feelings of love to God, and thus tended
            to foster a kind of religious sentimentalism.</p>

            the excitement of pious feeling; their sensuously sweet sacred

            oracles, and were intended to give a special impress to the
            religious feelings of the day. As early as <span class=

            hymn-book containing 972 hymns. Most of these were compositions
            of their own, a true reflection of their religious sentiments at
            that period. It also contained Bohemian and Moravian hymns,
            translated by Mich. Weiss, and also many old favourites of the
            evangelical church, often sadly <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1749 it had
            received twelve appendices and four supplements. In these
            appendices, especially in the twelfth, the one-sided tendency to
            give prominence to feeling was carried to the most absurd lengths
            of caricature in the use of offensive and silly terms of
            endearment as applied to the Saviour. Zinzendorf admitted the
            defects of this production, and had it suppressed in 1751, and in
            London prepared a new, expurgated edition of the hymn-book. Under
            Spangenberg's presidency Christian Gregor issued, in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1778, a hymn-book,
            containing 542 from Zinzendorf's book and 308 of his own pious
            rhymes. He also published a chorale book in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1784. Among their
            sacred poets Zinzendorf stands easily first. His only son,
            Christian Renatus, who died <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1752, left behind
            him a number of sacred songs. Their hymns were usually set to the
            melodies of the Halle pietists.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">10. In regard
            to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Christian life</span></em>, the Brotherhood
            withdrew from politics and society, adopted stereotyped forms of
            speech and peculiar usages, even in their dress. They sought to
            live undisturbed by controversy, in personal communion with the
            Saviour. Their separatism as a covenanted people may be excused
            in view of the unbelief prevailing in the Protestant church, but
            it has not been overcome by the reawakening of spiritual life in
            the Church. As to their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">ecclesiastical constitution</span></em>,
            Christ Himself, as the Chief Elder of the church, should have in
            it the direct government. The leaders, founding upon Proverbs
            xvi. 33 and Acts i. 26, held that fit expression was given to
            this principle by the use of the lot; but soon opposition to this
            practice arose, and with its abandonment the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“special covenant”</span> theory lost all its
            significance. The lot was used in election of office-bearers,
            sending of missionaries, admission to membership, etc. But in
            regard to marriage, it was used only by consent of the candidates
            for marriage, and an adverse result was not enforced. The
            administration of the affairs of the society lay with the
            conference of the united elders. From time to time general synods
            with legislative power were summoned. The membership was divided
            into groups of married, widowed, bachelors, maidens, and
            children, with special duties, separate residences, and also
            special religious services in addition to those common to all.
            The church officers were bishops, presbyters, deacons,
            deaconesses, and acolytes.</p>

            Eskimos of Labrador, etc. Their missionary enterprise forms the
            most brilliant and attractive part of the history of the
            Moravians. Their procedure was admirably suited to uncultured
            races, and only for such. In the East Indies, therefore, they
            were unsuccessful. They were never wanting in self-denying
            missionaries, who resigned all from love to the Saviour. They
            were mostly pious, capable artisans, who threw themselves with
            all their hearts into their new work, and devoted themselves with
            affectionate tenderness to the advancement of the bodily and
            spiritual interests of those among whom they laboured. One of the
            noblest of them all was the missionary patriarch Zeisberger, who
            died in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            among the North American Indians for sixty-three years. These
            missions were conducted at a surprisingly small outlay. The

            Lutheran opposition. In the Dutch and German Reformed Churches,
            even during the eighteenth century, Cocceianism was still in high
            repute. After it had modified strict Calvinism, the opposition
            between Reformed orthodoxy and Arminian heterodoxy became less
            pronounced, and more and more Arminian tendencies found their way
            into Reformed theology. What pietism and Moravianism were for the

            Jablonsky engaged in negotiations with England for the
            introduction of the Anglican episcopal system into Prussia, in
            order by it to build a bridge for the union with Lutheranism. But

            century the flames burst forth anew, reaching a height in 1712,
            when a marble bust of Cocceius was erected in a Leyden church. An
            obstinate Voetian, Pastor Fruytier of Rotterdam, was grievously
            offended at this proceeding, and published a controversial
            pamphlet full of the most bitter reproaches and accusations
            against the Cocceians, which, energetically replied to by the
            accused, was much more hurtful than useful to the interests of
            the Voetians. At last a favourable hearing was given to a word of
            peace which a highly respected Voetian, the <span class=

            years of age, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">J. Mor. Mommers</span></em>, addressed to
            the parties engaged in the controversy. He published in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1738, under the

            "font-style: italic">Eubulus</span></span>,”</span> a tract in
            which he proved that neither Cocceius himself nor his most
            distinguished adherents had in any essential point departed from
            the faith of the Reformed church, and that from them, therefore,
            in spite of all differences that had since arisen, the hand of
            fellowship should not be withheld. In consequence of this, the
            magistrates of Gröningen first of all decided, that forthwith, in
            filling up vacant pastorates, a Cocceian and Voetian should be
            appointed alternately; a principle which gradually became the
            practice throughout the whole country. At the same time also care
            was now taken that in the theological faculties both schools
            should have equal representation. But meanwhile also new
            departures had been made in each of the two parties. Among the
            Voetians, after the pattern formerly given them by Teellinck
            (<a href="#Section_162_Para_4" class="tei tei-ref">§ 162, 4</a>),
            followed up by the Frisian preacher Theod. Brakel, died

            made considerable progress; and the Cocceians, in the person of
            Hermann Witsius, drew more closely toward the pietism of the
            Voetians and the Lutherans. The most distinguished representative
            of this conciliatory party was F. A. Lampe of Detmold, afterwards
            professor in Utrecht, previously and subsequently pastor in
            Bremen, in high repute in his church as a hymn-writer, but best
            known by his commentary on John.—These conciliatory measures were
            frustrated by the publication, in <span class=

            immediate enlightenment of the Holy Spirit, evidenced by deep
            groanings and convulsive writhings. It was condemned by all the
            orthodox. The author now confined himself to his pastorate, where
            he was richly blessed. He died in <span class=

            enthusiastically along with them. In <span class=

            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1735 the brothers
            Wesley went to America to labour for the conversion of the
            Indians in Georgia. On board ship they met Nitschmann, and in
            Savannah Spangenberg, who exercised a powerful influence over
            them. John Wesley accepted a pastorate in Savannah, but
            encountered so many hindrances, that he decided to return to
            England in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1738. Whitefield
            had just sailed for America, but returned that same year.
            Meanwhile Wesley visited Marienborn and Herrnhut, and so became
            personally acquainted with Zinzendorf. He did not feel thoroughly
            satisfied, and so declined to join the society. On his return he
            began, along with Whitefield, the great work of his life. In many
            cities they founded religious societies, preached daily to
            immense crowds in Anglican churches, and when the churches were
            refused, in the open air, often to 20,000 or even 30,000 hearers.
            They sought to arouse careless sinners by all the terrors of the
            law and the horrors of hell, and by a thorough repentance to
            bring about immediate conversion. An immense number of hardened
            sinners, mostly of the lower orders, were thus awakened and
            brought to repentance amid shrieks and convulsions. Whitefield,
            who divided his attentions between England and America, delivered
            in thirty-four years 18,000 sermons; Wesley, who survived his
            younger companion by twenty-one years, dying in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1791, and was wont
            to say the world was his parish, delivered still more. Their
            association with the Moravians had been broken off in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1740. To the
            latter, not only was the Methodists' style of preaching
            objectionable, but also their doctrine of <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Christian perfection,”</span> according to which the
            true, regenerate Christian can and must reach a perfect holiness
            of life, not indeed free from temptation and error, but from all
            sins of weakness and sinful lusts. Wesley in turn accused the
            Herrnhuters of a dangerous tendency toward the errors of the
            quietists and antinomians. Zinzendorf came himself to London to
            remove the misunderstanding, but did not succeed. The great
            Methodist leaders were themselves separated from one another in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1741. Whitefield's
            doctrine of grace and election was Calvinistic; Wesley's
            Arminian.—From <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1748 the <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Countess of
            Huntingdon</span></em> attached herself to the Methodists, and
            secured an entrance for their preaching into aristocratic
            circles. With all her humility and self-sacrifice she remained
            aristocrat enough to insist on being head and organizer. Seeing
            she could not play this <span class=
            "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">rôle</span></span>
            with Wesley, she attached herself closely to Whitefield. He
            became her domestic chaplain, and with other clergymen
            accompanied her on her travels. Wherever she went she posed as a
            <span class="tei tei-q">“queen of the Methodists,”</span> and was
            allowed to preach and carry on pastoral work. She built sixty-six
            chapels, and in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1768 founded a
            seminary for training preachers at Trevecca in Wales, under the
            oversight of the able and <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            control to herself. After Whitefield's death, in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1770, the
            opposition between the Calvinistic followers of Whitefield and
            the Arminian Wesleyans burst out in a much more violent form.
            Fletcher and his likeminded fellow labourers were charged with
            teaching the horrible heresy of the universality of grace, and
            were on that account discharged by the countess from the seminary
            of Trevecca. They now joined Wesley, around whom the great
            majority of the Methodists had gathered.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><a name=

            from the episcopal church, but to work as a leaven within it.
            Whitefield was able to maintain this connexion by the aid of his
            aristocratic countess and her relationship with the higher
            clergy; but Wesley, spurning such aid, and trusting to his great
            powers of organization, felt driven more and more to set up an
            independent society. When the churches were closed against him
            and his fellow workers, and preaching in the open air was
            forbidden, he built chapels for himself.<a id="noteref_66" name=

            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1739. When his
            ordained associates were too few for the work, he obtained the
            assistance of lay preachers. He founded two kinds of religious
            societies: The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">band societies</span></em> only the tried
            and proved of his followers. Then he divided the <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">united
            societies</span></em> again into <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=

            persons each, and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">class-leaders</span></em> were required to
            give accurate accounts of the spiritual condition and progress of
            those under their care. Each member of the <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=

            "font-style: italic">stewards</span></em>, who also took care of
            the poor. A number of local societies constituted a <em class=

            fasts and lovefeasts, an annual service for the renewing of the
            covenant, and a great multiplication of prayer-meetings, gave a
            special character to Methodistic piety. Charles Wesley composed
            hymns for their services. They carefully avoided collision with
            the services of the state church. The American Methodists, who
            had been up to this time supplied by Wesley with itinerant

            opposition to all right order, to ordain for them by his own hand
            several preachers, and to appoint, in the person of Thomas Coke,
            a superintendent, who assumed in America the title of bishop.
            Coke became the founder of the Methodist Episcopal Church of
            America, which soon outstripped all other denominations in its
            zeal for the conversion of sinners, and in consequent success.
            The breach with the mother church was completed by the adoption
            of a creed in which the Thirty-nine Articles were reduced to
            twenty-five. At the last conference presided over by Wesley,

            the eighteenth century, like the Reformation of the sixteenth,
            was followed by the appearance of all sorts of fanatics and
            extremists. The converted were collected into little companies,
            which, as <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=

            prevailing darkness, and out of these arose separatists who spoke
            of the church as Babylon, regarded its ordinances impure, and its
            preaching a mere jingle of words. They obtained their spiritual
            nourishment from the mystical and theosophical writings of Böhme,
            Gichtel, Guyon, Poiret, etc. Their chief centre was Wetterau,
            where, in the house of Count Casimir von Berleburg, all
            persecuted pietists, separatists, fanatics, and sectaries found
            refuge. The count chose from them his court officials and
            personal servants, although he himself belonged to the national
            Reformed church. There was scarcely a district in Protestant
            Germany, Switzerland, and the Netherlands where there were not
            groups of such separatists; some mere harmless enthusiasts,
            others circulated pestiferous and immoral doctrines. Quite apart
            from pietism Swedenborgianism made its appearance, claiming to
            have a new <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg

            revelation. Of the older sects the Baptists and the Quakers sent
            off new swarms, and even predestinationism gave rise to a form of
            mysticism allied to pantheism.</p>

            trivialities and absurdities. The mysticism which is prominent in
            this work lacks originality, and is compiled from the
            mystico-theosophical writings of all ages from Origen down to

            judgment upon a depraved church and world, but without
            fanatical-sensual chiliasm. Also, except in the contempt of the
            sacraments, they held by the essentials of the church doctrine.

            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1730, and paid them
            a visit in person at Berleberg. Rock's profound Christian
            personality made a deep impression upon him. But he was offended
            at their contempt of the sacraments, and at the convulsive
            character of their utterances. This, however, did not hinder him
            from expressing his reverence for their able leader, who in
            return visited Zinzendorf at Herrnhut in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1732. In the
            interests of his own society Zinzendorf shrank from identifying
            himself with those of Wetterau. Rock denounced him as a new
            Babylon-botcher, and he retaliated by calling Rock a false
            prophet. When the Herrnhuters were driven from Wetterau in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            communities entered on their inheritance. But with Rock's death
            in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            ceased among them. They sank more and more into insignificance,
            until the revival of spiritual life, <span class=

            them into prominence again. Government interference drove most of
            them to America.</p>

            to write in a scoffing tone of all orthodox Christianity, with a
            strange blending of mysticism and rationalism, but without any
            trace profound Christian experience. Persecuted on every hand,
            exiled or imprisoned, he went hither and thither through Germany,
            Holland, Denmark, and Sweden, and found a refuge at last at

            to win him over; but he declared that he would rather give
            himself to the devil than to this Spirit of God. He was long

            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Buttlar
            sect</span></em>, founded by Eva von Buttlar, a native of Hesse,
            who had married a French refugee, lived gaily for ten years at
            the court of Eisenach, and then joined the pietists and became a
            rigid separatist. Separated from her husband, she associated with
            the licentiate Winter, and founded a Philadelphian society at
            Allendorf in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1702, where the
            foulest immoralities were practised. Eva herself was reverenced
            as the door of paradise, the new Jerusalem, the mother of all,
            Sophia come from heaven, the new Eve, and the incarnation of the
            Spirit. Winter was the incarnation of the Father, and their son
            Appenfeller the incarnation of the Son. They pronounced marriage
            sinful; sensual lusts must be slain in spiritual communion, then
            even carnal association is holy. Eva lived with all the men of
            the sect in the most shameless adultery. So did also the other
            women of the community. Expelled from Allendorf after a stay of
            six weeks, they sought unsuccessfully to gain a footing in
            various places. At Cologne they went over to the Catholic church.
            Their immoralities reached their climax at Lüde near Pyrmont.
            Winter was sentenced to death in <span class=

            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1706, but was let
            off with scourging. Eva escaped the same punishment by flight,
            and continued her evil practices unchecked for another year. She
            afterwards returned to Altona, where with her followers leading
            outwardly an honourable life, she attached herself to the
            Lutheran church, and died, honoured and esteemed, in <span class=

            widow, but soon found more pleasure in a handsome young lady,
            Anna von Buchel, who by a nervous sympathetic infection was
            driven into prophetic ecstasy. She proclaimed the speedy arrival
            of the millennium; Eller identified her with the mother of the
            man-child (Rev. xii. 1). When his wife had pined away through
            jealousy and neglect and died, he married Buchel. The first child
            she bore him was a girl, and the second, a boy, soon died. When a
            strong opposition arose in Elberfeld against the sect, he, along
            with his followers, founded Ronsdorf, as a New Zion, in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1737. The colony
            obtained civil rights, and Eller was made burgomaster. Anna
            having died in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1744, Eller gave
            his colony a new mother, and practised every manner of deceit and
            tyranny. After the infatuation had lasted a long time, the eyes
            of the Reformed pastor Schleiermacher, grandfather of the famous
            theologian, were at last opened. By flight to the Netherlands he
            escaped the fate of another revolter, whom Eller persuaded the
            authorities at Düsseldorf to put to death as a sorcerer. Every
            complaint against himself was quashed by Eller's bribery of the
            officials. After his death in <span class=

            speculative ability. After long examination of the secrets of

            called by these revelations to restore corrupted Christianity by
            founding a church of the New Jerusalem as the finally perfected
            church. He published the apocalyptic revelations as a new gospel:

            his views never got much hold in his native country. They spread
            more widely in England, where John Clowes, rector of St. John's
            Church, Manchester, translated his writings, and himself wrote
            largely in their exposition and commendation. Separate
            congregations with their own ministers, and forms of worship,
            sprang up through England in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>
            1788, and soon there were as many as fifty throughout the
            country. From England the New Church spread to America.—In
            Germany it was specially throughout Württemberg that it found
            adherents. There, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            (<a href="#Section_171_Para_9" class="tei tei-ref">§ 171, 9</a>)
            recognised Swedenborg's revelations, and introduced many elements
            from them into his theosophical system.—Swedenborg's religious
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg 137]</span><a name=
            "Pg137" id="Pg137" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> system was
            speculative mysticism, with a physical basis and rationalizing
            results. The aim of religion with him is the opening of an
            intimate correspondence between the spiritual world and man, and
            giving an insight into the mystery of the connexion between the
            two. The Bible (excluding the apostolic epistles, as merely
            expository), pre-eminently the Apocalypse, is recognised by him
            as God's word; to be studied, however, not in its literal but in
            its spiritual or inner sense. Of the church dogmas there is not
            one which he did not either set aside or rationalistically
            explain away. He denounces in the strongest terms the church
            doctrine of the Trinity. God is with him only one Person, who
            manifests Himself in three different forms: the Father is the
            principle of the manifesting God; the Son, the manifested form;
            the Spirit, the manifested activity. The purpose of the
            manifestation of Christ is the uniting of the human and Divine;
            redemption is nothing more than the combating and overcoming of
            the evil spirits. But angels and devils are spirits of dead men
            glorified and damned. He did not believe in a resurrection of the
            flesh, but maintained that the spiritual form of the body endures
            after death. The second coming of Christ will not be personal and
            visible, but spiritual through a revelation of the spiritual
            sense of Holy Scripture, and is realized by the founding of the
            church of the New Jerusalem.<a id="noteref_71" name="noteref_71"

            prophets of the Cevennes who fled to England in <span class=

            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1705. They
            converted a Quaker family at Bolton in Lancashire named Wardley,
            and the community soon grew. In <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1758 Anna Lee, wife
            of a farrier Stanley, joined the society, and, as the apocalyptic
            bride, inaugurated the millennium. She taught that the root of
            all sin was the relationship of the sexes. Maltreated by the mob,
            she emigrated to America, along with thirty companions, in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1774. Though
            persecuted here also, the sect increased and formed in the State
            of New York the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Millennial Church</span></em> or <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">United Society of
            Believers</span></em>. Anna died in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1784; but her
            prophets declared that she had merely laid aside the earthly garb
            and assumed the heavenly, so that only then the veneration of
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Mother Anna”</span> came into force. As
            Christ is the Son of the eternal Wisdom, Anna is the daughter; as
            Christ is the second Adam, she is the second Eve, and spiritual
            mother of believers as Christ is their father. Celibacy,
            community of goods, common labour (chiefly gardening), as a
            pleasure, not a burden, common domestic life as brothers and
            sisters, and constant intercourse with the spirit world, are the
            main points in her doctrine. By the addition of voluntary
            proselytes and the adoption of poor helpless children the sect
            has grown, till now it numbers 3,000 or 4,000 souls in eighteen
            villages. The capital is New Lebanon in the State of New York.
            The name Shakers was given them from the quivering motion of body
            in their solemn dances. In their services they march about
            singing <span class="tei tei-q">“On to heaven we will be
            going,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“March heavenward, yea,
            victorious band,”</span> etc. Like the Quakers (<a href=
            "#Section_163_Para_6" class="tei tei-ref">§ 163, 6</a>) they have
            neither a ministry nor sacraments, and their whole manner of life
            is modelled on that of the Quakers. The purity of the relation of
            brothers and sisters has always been free from suspicion.<a id=

            doctrine of their own sinlessness. About the same time sprang up

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In England
            during the first half of the century deism had still several
            active propagandists, and throughout the whole century efforts,
            not altogether unsuccessful, were made to spread Unitarian views.
            From the middle of the century, when the English deistic unbelief
            had died out, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Illumination,”</span>
            under the name of rationalism, found an entrance into Germany.
            Arminian pelagianism, recommended by brilliant scholarship,
            English deism, spread by translations and refutations, and French
            naturalism, introduced by a great and much honoured king, were
            the outward factors in securing this result. The freemason
            lodges, carried <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page140">[pg
            140]</span><a name="Pg140" id="Pg140" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            into Germany from England, a relic of mediævalism, aided the
            movement by their endeavour after a universal religion of a moral
            and practical kind. The inward factors were the Wolffian
            philosophy (<a href="#Section_167_Para_3" class="tei tei-ref">§
            167, 3</a>), the popular philosophy, and the pietism, with its
            step-father separatism (<a href="#Section_170" class=
            "tei tei-ref">§ 170</a>), which immediately prepared the soil for
            the sowing of rationalism. Orthodoxy, too, with its formulas that
            had been outlived, contributed to the same end. German
            rationalism is essentially distinguished from Deism and
            Naturalism by not breaking completely with the Bible and the
            church, but eviscerating both by its theories of accommodation
            and by its exaggerated representations of the limitations of the
            age in which the books of Scripture were written and the
            doctrines of Christianity were formulated. It thus treats the
            Bible as an important document, and the church as a useful
            religious institution. Over against rationalism arose
            supernaturalism, appealing directly to revelation. It was a
            dilution of the old church faith by the addition of more or less
            of the water of rationalism. Its reaction was therefore weak and
            vacillating. The temporary success of the vulgar rationalism lay,
            not in its own inherent strength, but in the correspondence that
            existed between it and the prevailing spirit of the age. The
            philosophy, however, as well as the national literature of the
            Germans, now began a victorious struggle against these
            tendencies, and though itself often indifferent and even hostile
            to Christianity, it recognised in Christ a school-master.
            Pestalozzi performed a similar service to popular education by
            his attempts to reform effete systems.</p>

            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Wm.
            Whiston</span></em>, a distinguished mathematician, physicist,
            and astronomer of the school of Sir Isaac Newton, and his
            successor in the mathematical chair at Cambridge. Deprived of
            this office in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1708 for spreading
            his heterodox views, he issued in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=

            work, <span class="tei tei-q">“Primitive Christianity
            Revived,”</span> in which he justified his Arian doctrine of
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page142">[pg 142]</span><a name=
            "Pg142" id="Pg142" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the Trinity as
            primitive and as taught by the ante-Nicene Fathers, and insisted
            upon augmenting the N.T. canon by the addition of twenty-nine

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Constitutions”</span> and <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Recognitions”</span> which he maintained were
            genuine works of Clement. Subsequently he adopted Baptist views,
            and lost himself in fantastic chiliastic speculations. He died
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1752. More sensible
            and moderate was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            distinguished as a mathematician of Newton's school and as a
            classical philologist. As an opponent of deism in sermons and
            treatises he had gained a high reputation as a theologian, when
            his work, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Scripture Doctrine of the
            Trinity,”</span> in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1712, led to his
            being accused of Arianism by convocation; but by conciliatory
            explanations he succeeded in retaining his office till his death
            in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1729. But the
            excitement caused by the publication of his work continued
            through several decades, and was everywhere the cause of

            assent to the Scriptures. This prayer was rejected in the Lower
            House by 217 votes against 71. Lindsey now resigned his clerical

            Unitarian movement in 1782, giving it a new impetus by his high
            scientific reputation. He wrote the <span class=

            to show that it had been forced upon the church against her will
            from the Platonic philosophy. These and a whole series of other
            controversial writings occasioned great excitement, not only
            among theologians, but also among the English people of all

            step toward the formation of freemason lodges of the modern type
            was taken about the end of the sixteenth century, when men of
            distinction in other callings sought admission as honorary
            members. After the rebuilding of London and the completion of St.

            lodge in London, which, renouncing material masonry, assumed the
            task of rearing the temple of humanity. In <span class=

            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1721 the Rev. Mr.
            Anderson prepared a constitution for this reconstruction of a
            trade society into a universal brotherhood, according to which
            all <span class="tei tei-q">“free masons”</span> faithfully
            observing the moral law as well as all the claims of humanity and
            patriotism, came under obligation to profess the religion common

            without any individual being thereby hindered from holding his
            own particular views. Although, in imitation of the older

            bound to observe the strictest secrecy in regard to their masonic
            signs, rites of initiation and promotion, and forms of greeting,
            it is not properly a secret society, since the constitution was

            publication of an immense series of writings in a rough but
            powerful style, filled with bitter scorn for positive
            Christianity. He went from one sect to another, but never found
            what he sought. In <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1741 he accepted
            Zinzendorf's invitation, and stayed with the <span class=

            next joined the Berleberg separatists, because they despised the
            sacraments, and contributed to their Bible commentary, though
            Haug had to alter much of his work before it could be used. This
            and his contempt for prayer brought the connexion between him and
            the society to an end. He then led a vagabond life up and down
            through Germany. Edelmann regarded himself as a helper of
            providence, and at least a second Luther. Christianity he
            pronounced the most irrational of all religions; church history a
            conglomeration of immorality, lies, hypocrisy, and fanaticism;
            prophets and apostles, bedlamites; and even Christ by no means a
            perfect pattern and teacher. The world needs only one
            redemption—redemption from Christianity. Providence, virtue, and
            immortality are the only elements in religion. No less than 166
            separate treatises came from his facile pen.—<em class=

            Frederick the Great.</span></em> Hostility to all positive
            Christianity spread from England and France into Germany. The
            writings of the English deists were translated and refuted, but
            mostly in so weak a style that the effect was the opposite of
            that intended. Whilst English deism with its air of thoroughness
            made way among the learned, the poison of frivolous French
            naturalism committed its ravages among the higher circles. The
            great king of Prussia <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            surrounded by French freethinkers Voltaire, D'Argens, La Metrie,
            etc., wished every man in his kingdom to be saved after his own
            fashion. In this he was quite earnest, although his personal
            animosity to all ecclesiastical and pietistic religion made him
            sometimes act harshly and unjustly. Thus, when Francke of Halle
            (son of the famous A. H. Francke) had exhorted his theological
            students to avoid the theatre, the king, designating him
            <span class="tei tei-q">“hypocrite”</span> Francke, ordered him
            to attend the theatre himself and have his attendance attested by
            the manager. His bitter hatred of all <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“priests”</span> was directed mainly against their
            actual or supposed intolerance, hypocrisy, and priestly
            arrogance; and where he met with undoubted integrity, as in
            Gellert and Seb. Bach, or simple, earnest piety, as in General
            Ziethen, he was not slow in paying to it the merited tribute of
            hearty acknowledgment and respect. His own religion was a
            philosophical deism, from which he could thoroughly refute
            Holbach's materialistic <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="fr"

            popular philosophy (Moses Mendelssohn, Garve, Eberhard, Platner,
            Steinbart, etc.), which started from the Wolffian <span class=

            Christian contents, there arose a weak, vapoury, and
            self-satisfied philosophizing on the part of the common human
            reason. Basedow was the reformer of pedagogy in the sense of the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Illumination,”</span> after the style of
            Rousseau, and crying up his wares in the market made a great
            noise for a while, although Herder declared that he would not
            trust calves, far less men, to be educated by such a pedagogue.

            literary Inquisition tribunal against all faith in revelation or
            the church. The <span class="tei tei-q">“Illumination”</span> in
            the domain of theology took the name of rationalism. Pietistic
            Halle cast its skin, and along with Berlin took front rank among
            the promoters of the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Illumination.”</span> In the other universities
            champions of the new views soon appeared, and rationalistic
            pastors spread over all Germany, to preach only of moral
            improvement, or to teach from the pulpit about the laws of
            health, agriculture, gardening, natural science, etc. The old
            liturgies were mutilated, hymn-books revised after the barbarous
            tastes of the age, and songs of mere moral tendency substituted
            for those that spoke of Christ's atonement. An ecclesiastical
            councillor, Lang of Regensburg, dispensed the communion with the
            words: <span class="tei tei-q">“Eat this bread! The Spirit of
            devotion rest on you with His rich blessing! Drink a little wine!
            The virtue lies not in this wine; it lies in you, in the divine
            doctrine, and in God.”</span> The Berlin provost, W. Alb. Teller,
            declared publicly: <span class="tei tei-q">“The Jews ought on
            account of their faith in God, virtue, and immortality, to be
            regarded as genuine Christians.”</span> C. Fr. Bahrdt, after he
            had been deposed for immorality from various clerical and
            academical offices, and was cast off by the theologians, sought
            to amuse the people with his wit as a taphouse-keeper in Halle,

            Ernesti of Leipzig, in the department of N.T. exegesis; Michaelis
            of Göttingen, in O.T. exegesis; Semler of Halle, in biblical and
            historical criticism; and Töllner of Frankfort-on-the-Oder, in
            dogmatics. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            specially eminent as a classical scholar, and maintained his
            reputation in that department, even after becoming professor of
            theology in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1761, made it an
            axiom of exegesis that the exposition of Scripture should be
            conducted precisely as that of any other book. But even in the
            domain of classical literature there must be an understanding of
            the author as a whole, and the expositor must have appreciation
            of the writer's spirit, as well as have acquaintance with his
            language and the customs of his age. And just from Ernesti's want
            of this, his treatise on biblical hermeneutics is rationalistic,
            and he became the father of rationalistic exegesis, though
            himself intending to hold firmly by the doctrine of inspiration
            and the creed of the church.—What Ernesti did for the N.T.,

            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1750 professor at
            Göttingen, a man of varied learning and wide influence. He
            publicly acknowledged that he had never experienced anything of
            the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "la"><span style="font-style: italic">testimonium Sp. s.

            the Scriptures wholly on external evidences, <span class=

            miracles, prophecy, authenticity, etc., a spider's web easily
            blown to pieces by the enemy. No one has ever excelled him in the
            art of foisting his own notions on the sacred authors and making
            them utter his favourite ideas. A conspicuous instance of this is
            his <span class="tei tei-q">“Laws of Moses,”</span> in six
            vols.—In a far greater measure than either Ernesti or Michaelis
            did <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">J.

            Halle, help on the cause of rationalism. He had grown up under
            the influence of Halle pietism in the profession of a customary
            Christianity, which he called his private religion, which
            contributed to his life a basis of genuine personal piety. But
            with a rare subtlety of reasoning as a man of science, endowed
            with rich scholarship, and without any wish to sever himself from
            Christianity, he undermined almost all the supports of the
            theology of the church. This he did by casting doubt on the
            genuineness of the biblical writings, by setting up a theory of
            inspiration and accommodation <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page147">[pg 147]</span><a name="Pg147" id="Pg147" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> which admitted the presence of error,
            misunderstanding, and pious fraud in the Scriptures, by a style
            of exposition which put aside everything unattractive in the N.T.
            as <span class="tei tei-q">“remnants of Judaism,”</span> by a
            critical treatment of the history of the church and its
            doctrines, which represented the doctrines of the church as the
            result of blundering, misconception, and violence, etc. He was a
            voluminous author, leaving behind him no less than 171 writings.
            He sowed the wind, and reaped the whirlwind, by which he himself
            was driven along. He firmly withstood the installation of Bahrdt
            at Halle, opposed Basedow's endeavours, applied himself eagerly
            to refute the <span class="tei tei-q">“Wolfenbüttel
            Fragments”</span> of Reimarus, edited by Lessing in 1774-1778,
            which represented Christianity as founded upon pure deceit and
            fraud, and defended even the edict of Wöllner. But the current
            was not thus to be stemmed, and Semler died broken-hearted at the
            sight of the heavy crop from his own sowing.—J. Gr. Töllner,
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            Frankfort-on-the-Oder, was in point of learning and influence by
            no means equal to those now named; yet he deserves a place
            alongside of them, as one who opened the door to rationalism in
            the department of dogmatics. He himself held fast to the belief
            in revelation, miracles, and prophecy, but he also regarded it as
            proved that God saves men by the revelation of nature; the
            revelation of Scripture is only a more sure and perfect means. He
            also examined the divine inspiration of Scripture, and found that
            the language and thoughts were the authors' own, and that God was
            concerned in it in a manner that could not be more precisely
            determined. Finally, in treating of the active obedience of
            Christ, he gives such a representation of it as sets aside the
            doctrine of the church.</p>

            old orthodoxy without surrendering to rationalism, the
            supernaturalists sought to maintain their hold of the Scripture
            revelation. Many of them did so in a very uncertain way: their
            revelation had scarcely anything to reveal which was not already
            given by reason. Others, however, eagerly sought to preserve all
            essentially vital truths. Morus of Leipzig, Ernesti's ablest
            student, Less of Göttingen, Döderlein of Jena, Seiler of
            Erlangen, and Nösselt of Halle, were all representatives of this
            school. More powerful opponents of rationalism appeared in

            could break a lance even with the philosopher of Königsberg,
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Reinhard</span></em> of Dresden, the most
            famous preacher of his age. Reinhard's sermon on the Reformation
            festival of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1800 created such
            enthusiasm in favour of the Lutheran doctrine of justification,
            that government issued an edict calling the attention of all
            pastors to it as a model. The most distinguished apologists were
            the mathematician <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Euler</span></em> of St. Petersburg, the
            physiologist, botanist, geologist, and poet <em class=

            of Hamburg, who fought for the palladium of Lutheran orthodoxy
            against his rationalistic colleagues, against the theatre,
            against Barth, Basedow, and such-like, against the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Wolfenbüttel Fragments,”</span> against the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Sorrows of Werther,”</span> etc. His
            polemic may have been over-violent, and he certainly was not a
            match for such an antagonist as Lessing; he was, however, by no
            means an obscurantist, ignoramus, fanatic, or hypocrite, but a
            man in solemn earnest in all he did. In the field of church

            amid all, with his biblical realism and his theosophy, which held
            corporeity to be the end of the ways of God, he was firmly rooted

            digging in the soil it unearthed many a precious nugget, of whose
            existence the vulgar rationalism had never dreamed, without any
            intention of becoming a schoolmaster to lead to Christ. Kant
            showed the impossibility of a knowledge of the supernatural by
            means of pure reason, but admitted the ideas of God, freedom, and
            immortality as postulates of the practical reason and as
            constituting the principle of all religion, whose only content is
            the moral law. Christianity and the Bible are to remain the basis
            of popular instruction, but are to be expounded only in an
            ethical sense. While in sympathy with rationalism, he admits its
            baldness and self-sufficiency. His keen criticism of the pure
            reason, the profound knowledge of human weakness and corruption
            shown in his doctrine of radical evil, his categorical imperative
            of the moral law, were well fitted to awaken in more earnest
            minds a deep distrust of themselves, a modest estimate of the
            boasted excellences of their age, and a feeling that Christianity
            could alone meet their necessities.—<em class=

            expelled from his position in Jena, he changed his views, rushing
            from the verge of atheism into a mysticism approaching to
            Christianity. In his <span class="tei tei-q">“Guide to a Blessed

            religion from being a mere servant to morals, and sought the
            blessedness of life in the loving surrender of one's whole being
            to the universal Spirit, the full expression of which he found in
            John's Gospel. Pauline Christianity, on the other hand, with its
            doctrine of sin and redemption, seemed to him a deterioration,
            and Christ Himself only the most complete representative of the
            incarnation of God repeated in all ages and in every pious
            man.—In the closing years of the century, <em class=

            His lament on the downfall of the gods of Greece, even if not so
            intended by the poet himself, told not so much against orthodox
            Christianity as against poverty-stricken deism, which banished
            the God of Christianity from the world and set in his place the
            dead forces of nature. And if indeed he really thought that for
            religion's sake he should confess to no religion, he has
            certainly in many profoundly Christian utterances given
            unconscious testimony to Christianity.—The Jacobi philosophy of
            feeling found poetic interpreters in <em class=

            find the same combination of pious sentiment which is drawn
            toward Christianity and the sceptical understanding which allied
            itself to the revolt against the common orthodoxy. <em class=

            toward the Bible, the church, and Christianity an attitude
            similar to that of the philosopher of Königsberg. The conviction
            of the necessity and wholesomeness of a biblical foundation in
            all popular education was rooted in his heart, and he clearly saw
            the shallowness of the popular philosophy, whether presented
            under the eccentric naturalism of Rousseau or the bald
            utilitarianism of Basedow. His whole life issued from the very
            sanctuary of true Christianity, as seen in his self-sacrificing

            people were at heart firmly grounded in the Christianity of the
            Bible and the church, and where the pulpit failed had their
            spiritual wants supplied by the devout writings of earlier days.
            Where the modern vandalism of the <span class=

            the books of praise, the old church songs lingered in the
            memories of fathers and mothers, and were sung with ardour at
            family worship. For many men of culture, who were more exposed to
            danger, the Society of the Brethren afforded a welcome refuge.
            But even among the most accomplished of the nation many stood
            firmly in the old paths. Lavater and Stilling, Haller and Euler,
            the two Mosers, father and son, John von Müller and his brother
            J. G. Müller, are not by any means the only, but merely the best
            known, of such true sons of the church. In Württemberg and Berg,
            where religious life was most vigorous, religious sects were
            formed with new theological views which made a deep impression on
            the character and habits of the people. Also toward the end of
            the century an awakened zeal in home and foreign missions was the
            prelude of the glorious enterprises of our own days.</p>

            Music.</span></em>—Klopstock, followed by Cramer and Schlegel,
            introduced the vandalism of altering the old church hymns to suit
            modern tastes and views. But a few, like Herder and Schubert,
            raised their voices against such philistinism. The <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Illuminist”</span> alterations were unutterably
            prosaic, and the old pathos and poetry of the sixteenth and
            seventeenth century hymns were ruthlessly sacrificed. The
            spiritual songs of the noble and pious Gellert are by far the
            best productions of this period.—<em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Church
            Music</span></em> too now reached its lowest ebb. The old
            chorales were altered into modern forms. A multitude of new,
            unpopular melodies, difficult of comprehension, with a bald
            school tone, were introduced; the last trace of the old rhythm
            disappeared, and a weary monotony began to prevail, in which all
            force and freshness were lost. As a substitute, secular preludes,
            interludes, and concluding pieces were brought in. The people
            often entered the churches during the playing of operatic
            overtures, and were dismissed amid the noise of a march or waltz.
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg 154]</span><a name=
            "Pg154" id="Pg154" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> The church ceased
            to be the patron and promoter of music; the theatre and concert
            room took its place. The opera style thoroughly depraved the
            oratorio. For festival occasions, cantatas in a purely secular,
            effeminate style were composed. A true ecclesiastical music no
            longer existed, so that even Winterfeld closed his history of
            church music with Seb. Bach. It was, if possible, still worse
            with the mass music of the Roman Catholic church. Palestrina's
            earnest and capable school was completely lost sight of under the
            sprightly and frivolous opera style, and with the organ still
            more mischief was done than in the Protestant church.</p>

            layman, Michael Hahn, whose writings show profound insight into
            the truths of the gospel. He taught the doctrine of a double
            fall, in consequence of which he depreciated though he did not
            forbid marriage; of a restitution of all things; while he
            subordinated justification to sanctification, the Christ for us
            to the Christ in us, etc. As a reaction against this extreme
            arose the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            services as much brightness and joy as possible. Both sects
            spread over Württemberg and still exist, but in their common
            opposition to the destructive tendencies of modern times, they
            have drawn more closely together. In their chiliasm and

            the forms of the Anglican episcopal church. Though successful at
            first, it soon became rent by the incongruity of its elements. In

            of England. Through Metternich's arts it ultimately degenerated
            into an instrument of repression and tyranny.—Incongruous
            elements were present everywhere. The restoration of the papacy
            in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            Protestantism; while supernaturalism and pietism prevailing in
            the Lutheran and Reformed churches led to renewed attempts at
            union. Old sects were strengthened and new sects arose.
            Pantheism, materialism, and atheism, as well as socialism and
            communism, without concealment attacked Christianity; while
            pauperism and vagabondage, on the one hand, and the Stock
            Exchange swindling of capitalists, on the other, spread moral
            consumption through all classes of society. The ultramontanes,
            led by the Jesuits, reasserted the most arrogant claims of the
            papacy. The climax was reached when Pius IX. obtained a decree of

            it began to abate, philosophy exercised an important influence on
            the religious development of the age, both in the departments of
            science and of life. While rationalism was not able to transcend
            the standpoint of Kant, the other theological tendencies were
            more or less determined formally, and even materially by the
            philosophical movements of this period. Alongside of philosophy,
            literature, itself to a great extent coloured by contemporary
            philosophy, exerted a powerful influence on the religious
            opinions of the more cultured among the people. The sciences,
            too, came into closer relations, partly friendly, partly hostile,
            to Christianity; and art in some of its masterpieces paid a noble
            tribute to the church.</p>

            Kantian rationalism, modified by elements borrowed from Jacobi,
            influenced such theologians as De Wette. <em class=

            "font-style: italic">Schelling</span></em>, in his <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Philosophy of Identity,”</span> had advanced from
            Fichte's idealism to a pantheistic naturalism. From Fichte he had
            learned that this world is nothing without spirit; but while
            Fichte recognised this world, the <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">non-ego</span></em>, as reality only in so
            far as man seizes upon it and penetrates it by his spirit, and so
            raises it into real being, Schelling regards spirit as nothing
            else than the life of nature itself. In the lower stages of this
            nature-life spirit is still slumbering and dreaming, but in man
            it has attained unto consciousness. The nature-life as a whole,
            or the world-soul, is God; man is the reflex of God and the world
            in miniature, a microcosmos. In the world's development God comes
            into objective being and unfolds his self-consciousness;
            Christianity is the turning point in the world's history; its
            fundamental dogmas of revelation, trinity, incarnation, and
            redemption are suggestive attempts to solve the world's riddle.
            Schelling's poetic view of the world penetrated all the sciences,
            and gave to them a new impulse. Though hateful to the old
            rationalists, this system found ardent admirers among the younger
            theologians. As Schelling to Fichte, so <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Hegel</span></em>
            was attached to Schelling, and wrought his pantheistic naturalism
            into a pantheistic spiritualism. Not so much in the life of
            nature as in the thinking and doing of the human spirit,
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page159">[pg 159]</span><a name=
            "Pg159" id="Pg159" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the divine
            revelation is the unfolding of the divine self-consciousness from
            non-being into being. Judaism and Christianity are progressive
            stages of this process; Judaism stands far below classic
            paganism; but in Christianity we have the perfect religion, to be
            developed into the highest form of philosophy. The Protestant
            church doctrine was now again accorded the place of honour.
            Marheincke developed Lutheran orthodoxy into a system of
            speculative theology based on Hegelian principles; while Göschel
            infused into it a pietist spirit, which made many hail the new
            departure as the long-sought reconciliation of theology and
            philosophy. But after Hegel's death in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1831 the condition
            of matters suddenly changed. His school split into an orthodox
            wing following the master's ecclesiastical tendencies, and a
            heterodox wing which deified the human spirit. Strauss, Bauer,
            and Feuerbach led this heterodox party in theology, and Ruge in
            reference to social, æsthetic, and political questions.
            Persecuted by the state in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            Hegelians joined the rationalists, whom they had before sneered
            at as <span class="tei tei-q">“antediluvian theologians.”</span>
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Schelling</span></em>, who had been silent
            for almost thirty years, took Hegel's chair in Berlin as his

            dualistic doctrine of potencies, from which he finally advanced
            to a Christian gnosticism, obtained a temporary influence among
            the younger theologians. He died at the baths of Ragaz in
            Switzerland in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            philosophy was overthrown by the split in the school and the
            radicalism of the adherents of the left wing, and Schelling in
            the second stage of his philosophical development had not
            succeeded in founding any proper school of his own. A group of
            younger philosophers, with I. H. Fichte at their head, starting
            from the Hegelian dialectic, have striven to free philosophy from
            the reproach of pantheism and to develop a speculative theism in
            touch with historical Christianity. Other members of this school
            are Weisse, Braniss, Chalibæus, Ulrici, Wirth, Romang,
            etc.—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            declares the metaphysical end of their systems beyond the horizon
            of philosophy, which must limit itself to the province of
            experience. His realism is in diametrical opposition to Hegel's
            idealism. Toward Christianity his philosophy occupies a position
            of indifference. Influenced by Kant's theory of knowledge as well
            as by the Fichte-Schelling-Hegel idealism and Herbart's realism,
            with an infusion of Leibnitz's monad doctrine, <em class=

            attract attention, is in spirit utterly opposed to the religion
            and ethics of Christianity. Its task is to describe <span class=

            stage of entering into visibility which is represented in man
            does will, the thing-in-itself, become joined with idea, and
            makes its appearance now with it over against the world as a
            conscious subject. But since idea is regarded as a pure illusion
            of the will, this leads to a pessimism which takes absolute
            despair as the only legitimate moral principle. <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">E. von
            Hartmann</span></em> went still further in the same direction in
            his <span class="tei tei-q">“Philosophy of the
            Unconscious,”</span> published in 1869, of which an English
            translation in three vols. appeared in 1884. He identifies the
            will with matter and idea with spirit, demands in addition to the
            absolute despair of the individual here and hereafter, the
            complete surrender of the personality to the world-process in
            order to the attainment of its end, the annihilation of the
            world. This dissolution of the world consists in the complete
            withdrawal of the will into the absolute as the only unconscious,
            so that at last the wrong and misery of being produced by the
            irrational will are abolished in this withdrawal. From this
            philosophical standpoint Hartmann attempted in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1874 to take
            Christianity to pieces, showing some favour to Vatican
            Catholicism, but pouring out the vials of his wrath upon
            Protestantism. His <span class="tei tei-q">“religion of the
            future”</span> consists in a yearning for freedom from all the
            burden and misery of being and share in the world-process by
            relapsing into the blessedness of non-being.—In France, England,
            and America much favour has been shown to the atheistic-sensual
            Positivism of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Aug. Comte</span></em>, which, excluding
            every form of theology and morals, requires only the so-called
            exact sciences as the object of philosophy. On his later notions

            "font-style: italic">The Sciences.</span></em>—Schelling's
            profound theories were of all the more significance from their
            not being restricted to the philosophical strivings of his time,
            but inspiring the other sciences with the breath of a new life.
            To the fullest extent the natural sciences exposed themselves to
            this influence. There was not wanting indeed a certain shadowy
            mysticism, to which especially the fancies of mesmeric
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg 161]</span><a name=
            "Pg161" id="Pg161" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> magnetism largely
            contributed; but this fog gradually cleared away, and the
            Christian elements were purified from their pantheistic
            surroundings. Steffens and Von Schubert taught that the divine
            book of nature is to be regarded as the reflex and expansion of
            the divine revelation in Scripture. The Hegelian philosophy, too,
            seemed at first likely to infuse a Christian spirit into the
            other sciences. In Göschel, at least, there was a thinker who
            imparted to jurisprudence a Christian character, and to
            Christianity a juristic construction. In other respects Hegel's
            philosophy in its application to the other departments of science
            gave in many ways a predominance to an abstruse dialectic
            tendency. Its adherents of the extreme left sought to construct
            all sciences <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "la"><span style="font-style: italic">a priori</span></span> from
            the pure idea, and at the same time to root out from them the
            last vestiges of the Christian spirit.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The greatest
            names in natural science, Copernicus, Kepler, Newton, Haller,
            Davy, Cuvier, etc., are household words in Christian circles. All
            these and many more were firmly convinced that there was no
            conflict between their most brilliant discoveries and Christian
            truth. In <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1825 the Earl of
            Bridgwater founded a lectureship, and treatises on the power,
            wisdom, and goodness of God as manifested in the creation, have
            been written by Buckland, Chalmers, Whewell, Bell, etc. It was
            otherwise in Germany. Even Schleiermacher, in his <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Letters to Lücke,”</span> in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1829, expressed his
            fears of the prophesied overthrow of all Christian theories of
            the world by the incontrovertible results of physical research,
            and Bretschneider in his <span class="tei tei-q">“Letters to a
            Statesman,”</span> in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1830, proclaimed to
            the world without regret that already what Schleiermacher only
            feared had actually come to pass. Physicists, awakening from the
            glamour of the Schelling nature philosophy, pronounced all
            speculation contraband, and declared pure empiricism, the simple
            investigation of actual things, the only permissible object of
            their labour. And although they handed over to theologians and
            philosophers questions about spirit in and over nature, as not
            belonging to their province, a younger generation maintained that
            spirit was non-existent, because it could not be discovered by
            the microscope and dissecting knife. Carl Vogt defined thought to
            be a secretion of the brain, and Moleschott regarded life as a
            mere mode of matter and man's existence after life only as the
            manuring of the fields. Feuerbach proclaimed that <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“man is what he eats,”</span> and Buchner popularized
            these views into a gospel for social democrats and nihilists.
            Oersted, the famous discoverer of electro-magnetism, had sought
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the spirit in nature,”</span> but the
            spirit which he found was not that of the Bible and the church.
            The grandmaster of German scientific research, Alex. von
            Humboldt, saw in the world a cosmos of noble harmony as a whole
            and in its <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page162">[pg

            parts, but of Christian ideas in God's great book of nature he
            finds no trace. In <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            into the arena the theory of <span class="tei tei-q">“Natural
            Selection,”</span> by means of which the modification and
            development of the few primary animal forms through the struggle
            for existence and the survival of the fittest by sexual selection
            is supposed, in millions, perhaps milliards, of years, to have
            brought forth the present variety and manifoldness of animal
            species. Multitudes of naturalists now accept his theory of the
            descent of men and apes from a common stem.—In <em class=

            modern times is Leopold von Ranke, who, with his disciples,
            occupies a thoroughly Christian standpoint. There has appeared,
            however, on the part of many Protestant historians, such as
            Voigt, Leo, Mentzel, Vorreiter, Hurter, Gfroerer, etc., a
            tendency in the most conspicuous manner to recognise and admire
            the brilliant phenomena of mediæval Catholicism, even going to
            the length of renouncing the vital principles of Protestantism,
            and glorifying a Boniface, a Gregory VII., and an Innocent III.,
            and characterizing the Reformation as a revolution. Ultramontanes
            have been only too ready to turn to their own use all such
            concessions, but show no inclination to make similar admissions
            damaging to their side, so that with them history consists rather
            in the abuse of everything Protestant as vile and perfidious,

            some extent Goethe, but much more decidedly the romantic school
            of poets, was attached to Schelling's philosophy of nature. The
            romanticists developed a deep <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            Novalis and La Motte Fouqué, and violent opposition to
            rationalistic theology as shown in Tieck, which in the case of
            Fr. Schlegel ran to the other extreme of moral frivolity as seen
            in his <span class="tei tei-q">“Lucinde.”</span> The romantic
            school as thus represented by Schlegel was joined by the party of
            Young Germany with its gospel of the rehabilitation of the flesh.
            Its mouthpiece was the gifted poet Heine. The pantheistic
            deification of nature by Schelling, and the self-deification of
            the Hegelian school obtained poetic expression in Leop. Schafer's
            <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=

            "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Laienevangelium</span></span>; while the
            sympathies of the young Hegelians with the revolutionary
            movements gained utterance in the poems of Herwegh, and in a more
            serious tone in those of Freiligrath. More recently the views of
            the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

            "#Section_180" class="tei tei-ref">§ 180</a>) have found their
            poetical representative in Nic. Eichhorn, whose <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Jesus of Nazareth,”</span> a tragical drama, 1880,
            deals with the life, works, and sufferings of the <span class=

            noble patriotic songs of E. M. Arndt<a id="noteref_81" name=

            Max. von Schenkendorf much more distinctly than in the romantic
            school. Enthusiasm in the struggle for freedom awakened faith in
            the living God. Uhland's lovely lyrics, with their enthusiasm for
            the present interests of the Fatherland, entitle him to rank
            among patriotic poets, and their brilliant and profound rendering
            of the old German legends places him in the romantic school,
            which, however, in clearness and depth he leaves far behind.
            Without being a distinctively Christian poet, his warm sympathy
            with the life of the German people gives him a genuine interest
            in the Christian religion. The same may be said of Rückert's
            highly finished poems, which transplanted the fragrant flowers of
            oriental sensuousness and contemplativeness into the garden of
            German poetry. A more decided Christian consecration of poetic
            genius is seen in the noble and beautiful lyrics of Emanuel
            Geibel, died 1884, the greatest and most Christian of the secular
            poets of the present. Of those ordinarily ranked as sacred poets
            may be named Knapp, Döring, Spitta, Garve, Vict. Strauss, etc.,
            who for the most part contributed their sacred songs to Knapp's
            <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class=
            "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Christoterpe</span></span>”</span>
            (1833-1853). A later publication of equal merit, called the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class=
            "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Neue
            Christoterpe</span></span>,”</span> has been edited since 1880 by
            Kögel, Baur, and Frommel. But with all the Christian depth and
            spirituality, freshness and warmth, which we meet with in the
            productions of these Christian poets, none of them <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page164">[pg 164]</span><a name="Pg164" id=
            "Pg164" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> has been able to rise to the
            noble simplicity, power, popular force, and fitting them for
            church use, objectivity which are present in the old evangelical
            church hymns. In this respect they all bear too conspicuously the
            signature of their age, with its subjective tone and the noise
            and turmoil of present conflicts. Of all modern poets, Rückert
            alone approaches in his advent hymn the measure and spirit of the
            old church song.—In the department of novels and romance there
            has been shown an almost invariable hostility toward
            Christianity, religion being either entirely avoided or held up
            to contempt by having as its representatives, simpletons,
            hypocrites, or knaves.</p>

            on the half-pagan Christianity of the Middle Ages. In another
            work he makes the representatives of heathenism in the age of
            Constantine act like Homeric heroes, and those of Christianity
            speak <span class="tei tei-q">“like theologians of the age of
            Bossuet.”</span> Lamartine may be described as a Christian
            romanticist. Victor Hugo, Balzac, George Sand, Sue, Dumas, etc.,
            influenced by the Revolution, developed an antichristian
            tendency; while naked naturalism, photographic realism in
            depicting the lowest side of Parisian life, especially adultery
            and prostitution, is represented by Flaubert, Daudet, De
            Goncourt, Zola, etc.—In <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            affords a noble example of the sustaining power of true religion
            during ten years' rigorous imprisonment in an Austrian dungeon.
            The most gifted of modern Italian poets, Giacomo Leopardi, sank
            into despairing pessimism, which expressed itself in the domain
            of religion in biting satire and savage irony. Among the poets of
            the present who, with glowing patriotism, not only yearned for
            the deliverance and unity of Italy, but also lived to see these
            accomplished, and have since given expression, though from
            different political and religious standpoints, to the desire for
            the reconciliation of the free united kingdom with the
            irreconcilable church, the most distinguished, are Aleardi,
            Carducci, Imbriani, Guercini, Cavalotti.—In <em class=

            although the daughter of a German father, and educated in
            Germany, introduced, under the name Fernan Caballero, the modern
            romance in a thoroughly national Spanish style, and in a purely
            moral and catholic Christian spirit. In the <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Flemish
            Provinces</span></em>, Hendrik Conscience, the able novelist, has

            Christianity.—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            of the first rank, who more than any other poet had experience in
            himself of the convulsions and contradictions of his age. In

            weariness of life, and hatred of mankind, without hope, yet
            without desire for reconciliation, enthusiastic admiration of the
            ancient world, passionate love of liberty and titanic pride in
            human might mingle with scenes of grumbling, misery, and
            profligacy. On the other hand, the rich and mostly solid English
            novel literature is prevailingly inspired by a Christian
            spirit.</p>

            "font-style: italic">Popular Education.</span></em>—While the
            poetic national literature for the most part found entrance only
            among the cultured and adult circles, this age, almost as fond of
            writing as of reading, produced an enormous quantity of books for
            the people and for children. But only a few succeeded in catching
            the proper tone for the masses and the youth, and still fewer
            supplied their readers with what was genuinely pious.
            Pestalozzi's <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="de" class=

            respected at least the Christian feeling of the people, although
            they did not strengthen or foster it. But, on the other hand, in
            recent years a number of writers have appeared, thoroughly
            popular, and at the same time thoroughly Christian, who, as
            popular poets and novelists, have become apostles of Christian
            views, morals, and customs to the people. The most distinguished
            of these are Jeremiah Gotthelf (Albert Bitzius, died 1854), whose
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Kate the Grandmother”</span> was
            translated in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Sunday Magazine</span></em> for 1865, Von
            Horn, Carl Stöber, Wildenhahn, Nathusius, Frommel, Weitbrecht,
            etc. In the Catholic church Albanus Stoltz, died 1883, developed
            a wonderful power of popular composition, which, however, he
            subsequently put at the service of a fanatical ultramontanism,
            and so sacrificed much of its nobility and worth. From the
            enormous mass of children's books only extremely few attain their
            aim. In the front rank stands the brilliant patriarch of
            Christian tale writing, Von Schubert, died 1860. After him are
            Barth, the author of <span class="tei tei-q">“Poor Henry,”</span>
            Stöber, and the Swiss Spyri, and the Catholic Christian Schmid,
            author of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Easter Eggs.”</span>—The
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Public
            Schools</span></em>, especially under Dinter (died 1831), member
            of the consistory and schoolboard of Königsberg, were for a long
            time nurseries of the tame, flat, and self-satisfied rationalism
            of the <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "fr"><span style="font-style: italic">ancien
            régime</span></span>; but since 1830, and more particularly in
            consequence of the violent agitations of the seminary director
            Diesterweg, who died in 1866, put to silence in 1847, but still
            for his work in connexion with education always highly respected,
            many of the teachers took a higher flight in the
            naturalistic-democratic direction. By word and pen Diesterweg
            carried on a propaganda in favour of a free and liberal education
            for the people. His disciples, wanting his earnest Christian
            spirit, carried out recklessly his radical tendencies, and now
            the Christian faith has no more persistent foes than the teachers
            of the public schools. In <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1870, a Teachers'
            Association in Vienna gave a vote of 6,000 in <span class=

            Hamburg meeting in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1872 of 5,100
            teachers, progress was shown by individuals raising their voices
            in defence of Christianity, which, however, were generally
            drowned in shrieks and hisses. A Teachers' Evangelical
            Association held its ninth assembly at Hamburg in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1881 with 1,500
            members. Christian opinions are now ably represented in schools,
            educational journals, and literature. A burning question at
            present is whether the national school should be preferred to the
            denominational school. Liberals in church and state say it
            should; conservatives say it should not; while both parties think
            their views supported by the experience of the past. The Prussian
            minister of education, Falk, <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>
            1872-1879, firmly insisted upon the development of the national
            system, but his successors Von Puttkamer and Von Gossler reverted
            to the denominational system. The German Evangelical School
            Congress of Hamburg in October, 1882, demanded that both
            elementary and secondary schools should have a confessional
            character.</p>

            called forth with the opening of the new century imparted new
            spirit and life to the cultivation of the arts. Winckelmann, died

            the way to an understanding of pagan classical art, and
            romanticism awakened appreciation of and enthusiasm for mediæval
            Christian art. The greatest masters of <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Architecture</span></em> were Schinckel,
            Klenze, and Heideloff. The foundation stone of the final part of

            William IV., in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            masters, who gave expression to profound Christian ideas in
            bronze and marble, the Italian Canova, the German Dannecker, and
            greatest of all, the Dane Thorwaldsen, whose Christ and the
            Apostles and other works form a main attraction to visitors in
            Copenhagen. Three younger German masters of the art, who have
            heired their fame, are Rauch, Rietschl, and Drake.—In <em class=

            became perverts to Romanism. Peter Cornelius, the ablest of the
            school, himself born a Catholic, answered his friends' request to
            place Luther in a picture of the last judgment, in hell:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, but with the Bible in his hands and
            the devils trembling before him;”</span> and in a subsequent
            picture of the judgment, he gave the German reformer his place
            among the saints in heaven. His pupil, Julius Schnorr von

            the three great masters of musical composition, Mozart, Haydn,
            and Beethoven, produced in the department of sacred music some of
            their noblest works. Mendelssohn, in his St. Paul and Elijah and
            in his Psalms, sought to reproduce the power and truth of the
            simple word of God. An early death prevented him giving
            expression to his ideal of Christ in music. The Hungarian
            virtuoso Liszt sacrifices sacred calmness and dignity to
            theatrical effect. His son-in-law, Richard Wagner, inspired by
            Schopenhauer's philosophy, a richly endowed poet and composer,
            proclaimed by his followers as the Messiah of the music of the
            future, going back to mediæval legend, has produced a <span lang=
            "la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">quasi</span></span>-Christian musical drama,
            in which the gospel of pessimism takes the place of the gospel of
            the grace of God.—Quite different is the Passion Play of the
            Bavarian village Oberammergau, which is a reproduction of the
            mediæval mysteries (§ 115, 12). It originated in a vow made in
            1633 on the occasion of a plague which visited the place, and is
            repeated every ten years on the Sundays from the end of May to
            the middle of September. The history of the Saviour's passion is
            here represented with interludes from Messianic Old Testament
            passages explained by a chorus like that of the classical
            tragedy, with appropriate scenery, drapery, and musical
            accompaniment. In the presence of an immense concourse of
            strangers for whose accommodation a large amphitheatre was been
            built, almost all the villagers, men, women, and children, take
            part in the performance and show rare artistic power. The text of
            the drama for the most part agrees with the gospel narrative,
            only occasionally interspersed with legend, and quite free from
            ultramontane hagiology and mariolatry. The performance of
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1850, and still
            more that of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1880, attracted
            crowds of pilgrims and tourists to the quiet and remote valley.
            An independent exhibition, falling little behind the original in
            the artistic character of its composition and production, was
            given, in 1883, on the Sundays of July and August in the Tyrolese
            village of Brixlegg, and was visited by similar crowds.</p>

            (<a href="#Section_202_Para_2" class="tei tei-ref">§ 202, 2</a>),
            but even in Protestant Germany a Romanizing current set in on
            many sides. A taste for the romantic, artistic, historical (§
            174, <a href="#Section_174_Para_5" class="tei tei-ref">5</a>,
            <a href="#Section_174_Para_9" class="tei tei-ref">9</a>, <a href=

            feudalist-aristocratic and hyper-Lutheran ecclesiastical
            tendencies led the way in this direction. Many sought rest in the
            bosom of the church <span class="tei tei-q">“where alone
            salvation is found,”</span> while others, too deeply rooted in
            evangelical truth, bewailed the loss of <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“noble and venerable”</span> institutions in the
            worship, life, and constitution of the church, but were unable to
            accept the various unevangelical accretions which made void the
            doctrine of justification by faith alone. This was the position
            of Löhe of Neuendettelsau, in point of doctrine a strict
            Lutheran, who published a selection of Catholic legends as
            patterns of self-denial for his deaconesses, wished to restore
            anointing of the sick, etc. Some Protestant pastors expressed
            warm sympathy with the Pope during his misfortunes in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1860, and approved
            of the continuance of the papacy and the pope's temporal
            dominion. A conference of Catholics (Count Stolberg, Dr.
            Michelis, etc.) and Protestants (Leo, Bindewald, etc.) at Erfurt

            about a union of the churches. Still more remarkable is the story
            told by the Old Catholic professor Friedrich. Just before the
            opening of the Vatican Council, certain evangelical pastors of
            Saxony wrote letters to Bishop Martin of Paderborn, which
            Friedrich himself read, urging that at the council permission
            should be given to priests to marry and to give the cup in the
            communion to the laity, and promising that in that case they
            themselves and many like-minded pastors would join the Romish
            church. That the letters were written and received is
            unquestionable; but it is doubtful whether folly and imbecility
            or a wish to hoax and mystify, directed the pen. The writer or
            writers, as the examination before the consistory of the locality
            proved, are not to be sought among the pastors whose names are
            appended. How far the Protestant ultra-conservative reactionary
            party goes with the ultramontanes and how far it would aid the
            overthrow and undermining of the Protestant state and evangelical
            church, is shown by the conduct of the Privy Councillor and Chief
            Justice Ludwig von Gerlach (<a href="#Section_176_Para_1" class=
            "tei tei-ref">§ 176, 1</a>), who, in 1872, in the Prussian House
            of Representatives, took his place among the ultramontane party
            of the centre, hostile to the empire and friendly to the Poles,
            and in his pamphlet <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="de"

            1872 described the new German empire as an incarnate antichrist.
            Also the Lutheran Guelphs of Hanover are zealous supporters of
            all the demands of the centre in the Prussian parliament and in
            the German Reichstag.</p>

            essentially revolutionary, while Catholicism is the bulwark of
            the State against revolution and democracy, was affirmed with
            such audacity that even Protestant statesmen believed it. The
            Roman Jesuit Perrone (<a href="#Section_191_Para_9" class=

            rent the unity of the church, to the Jews who crucified the

            spreading the dominion of the prince of darkness. Prof. Hohoff of
            Paderborn, in his <span class="tei tei-q">“Hist. Studies on
            Protestantism and Socialism,”</span> Paderb., 1881, reiterated
            the accusation: <span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, it is so,
            Protestantism has begotten atheism, materialism, scepticism,
            nihilism. The Reformation was the murderer of all science, the
            greatest foe of culture and learning, and the falsifier of all
            history.... Melanchthon's <span class=

            unscientific production in the domain of dogmatics.... Yes, the
            Reformation has proved a prime source of superstition, a step
            backward in the history of civilization.... The Catholic church
            has been the champion of conscience, reason, and freedom.... No
            one is thoroughly capable of judging historical facts without
            prejudice as the believing Catholic Christian.”</span>—But while
            the vast majority of Catholic writers thus abuse Protestantism,
            others like Seltmann of Eberswald seek to win over to the ranks
            of the Romish church those who can be befooled by fair speeches.
            The <span class="tei tei-q">“Protestant”</span> correspondents in
            Seltmann's periodical write under the cloak of anonymity.—In
            Spain the Reformation was long attributed to the Augustinians,
            who were jealous of the Dominicans as the only dispensers of
            indulgences, and to Luther's desire to marry; but the poet Nuñez

            the church and papacy of its time, and regarded with sympathy the
            spiritual struggles of the reformer. Though as a good Catholic he
            concludes his poem with the ban of the church against Luther, he
            yet describes him as a just and well-deserving man.</p>

            eastern church before the Roman Catholic as well as Protestant.
            On the opening of the Vatican Council in 1869 he advocated in a
            pamphlet the breaking up of the papal church and the formation of
            Catholic national churches. In North America Professor Bjerring,
            of the Catholic seminary for priests at Baltimore, took the same
            position. In March, 1871, he went to St. Petersburg, was there
            ordained as an Orthodox priest, and on his return to New York
            instituted a Sunday service in the English language according to
            the Greek rite. Of any further advance in this direction of union
            nothing is known.</p>

            Daumer, the historian of ante-tridentine theology Hugo Lämmer,
            and Dr. Ed. Preuss, who had written against the immaculate

            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            Protestant pastor, went over to the Romish church, but the two
            new dogmas of Pius IX. led him to study the works of Luther. He
            now returned to the Lutheran church, vindicating his procedure in
            a treatise entitled, <span class="tei tei-q">“To Rome, and from
            Rome back again to Wittenberg, 1881.”</span> Also the Mecklenburg
            Lutheran pastor, Dr. A. Hager, who, after his conversion, had
            undertaken the editorship of an ultramontane newspaper in Breslau
            in 1873, was obliged in a few years to resign the appointment.
            His return to the evangelical church was being talked about, when
            he suddenly died in 1883, after having received the last
            sacrament in the Catholic church. The climax of abuse of Luther
            and the Lutheran church was reached by the Hanoverian Evers, who
            had gone over in 1880; in all his scandalous and vituperative
            writings he describes himself on the title page as <span class=

            special attention. The eight-year old son of the Jew Mortara of
            Bologna was violently taken from his parents to Rome because his
            Christian nurse said that two years before, during a dangerous
            illness, she had baptized him. The church answered the entreaties
            of the parents and the universal outcry by saying that the
            sacrament had an indelible character, and that the pope could not
            change the law. Again in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            old Jewish boy, Joseph Coën, apprentice weaver in Rome, was
            decoyed by a priest to his cloister and there persuaded to
            receive baptism. In vain his mother, the Jewish community, and

            opponent of the prevailing rationalism. Count Leopold von
            Seldnitzsky, formerly Prince-Bishop of Breslau, felt obliged in
            1840, in consequence of the conscientious objections he had to
            perform his official duties toward church and state during the
            ecclesiastico-political controversies of 1830 (<a href=
            "#Section_193_Para_1" class="tei tei-ref">§ 193, 1</a>), to
            resign his appointments. He was subsequently led in <span class=

            reading the Scriptures and Luther's works, after a sore struggle,
            to join the evangelical Church. He devoted all his means to the
            founding of Protestant educational institutions at Berlin and
            Breslau. He died in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            eighty-fourth year. The proclamation by the Vatican of the dogma
            of infallibility drove many pious and earnest Catholics out of
            the Romish communion. Of these Carl von Richthofen, Canon of
            Breslau, engages our special interest. Son of a pious Lutheran
            mother, and trained up under Gossner's mild spiritual direction
            (<a href="#Section_187_Para_2" class="tei tei-ref">§ 187, 2</a>),
            his gentle and deeply religious nature had attached itself to the
            Roman Catholic church of his father only under the illusion that
            the Romish doctrine of justification was not wholly
            irreconcilable with the evangelical doctrine. He at first
            submitted to but soon renounced the Vatican decree; was
            excommunicated by Archbishop Förster, voluntarily resigned his
            emoluments; joined the Old Catholics in <span class=

            following year he died a painful death from the explosion of a
            petroleum lamp.—Upon the whole Rome has made most converts in
            America and England; and she has suffered losses more or less

            eulogised Luther, while the ultramontanes loaded his memory with
            unmeasured calumny and reproach. The threatened

            philosophy and literature soon weakened its foundations, and the
            war of independence moved the hearts of the people toward the

            found Hase of Jena as keen an opponent as any pietist or orthodox
            controversialist. That recognised leader of the old rationalists
            had coolly attempted to substitute a new and rational form of

            Kiel, on the occasion of the Reformation centenary, opened an
            attack upon those who had fallen away from the faith of their
            fathers, by the publication of ninety-five new theses, recalling
            attention to Luther's almost forgotten doctrines. In <span class=

            Gesenius and Wegscheider of Halle with open contempt of Christian
            truth, and called for State interference. In all parts of
            Germany, amid the opposition of scientific theologians and the
            scorn of philosophers, pietism made way against rationalism, so
            that even men of culture regarded it as a reproach to be reckoned
            among the rationalists. Unbelief, however, was widespread among
            the masses. When Sintenis, preacher in Magdeburg in <span class=

            Halle, by starting the question, Whether the Scriptures or the
            reason is to be regarded as the standard of faith? shattered the
            illusion that rationalism still occupied the platform of the

            Schleiermacher took offence at the severe measures demanded by
            Hengstenberg and his party, and in 1846 issued in Berlin a
            manifesto with eighty-eight signatures against the paper pope of
            antiquated Reformation confessions and the inquisitorial
            proceedings of the <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign"

            inimical to all liberty of faith and conscience, wishing only to
            maintain firm hold of the truth that Jesus Christ is yesterday,
            to-day, and for ever the one and only ground of salvation. The
            Friends of Light, combining with the German Catholics and the
            Young Hegelians, founded Free churches at Halle, Königsberg, and
            many other places. Their services and sermons void of religion,
            in which the Bible, the living Christ, and latterly even the
            personal God, had no place, but only the naked worship of
            humanity, had temporary vitality imparted them by the
            revolutionary movements of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1848. This gave the
            State an excuse, long wished for, to interfere, and soon scarcely
            a trace of their churches was to be found.</p>

            driven out of the evangelical church during the period of
            ecclesiastical impoverishment, but, purified from many eccentric
            excesses, and seeking refuge and support for the most part by
            attaching itself to the community of the Moravian Brethren, it
            had, even in Württemberg, established itself independently and in

            theosophical-chiliastic spirit. There too a kind of spiritualism
            was introduced by the physician and poet Justin Kerner of
            Weinsberg, and the philosopher Eschenmayer of Tübingen, with
            spirit revelations from above and below. Amid the religious
            movements of the beginning of the century Pietism gained a
            decided advantage. It took the form of a protest against the
            rationalism prevailing among the clergy. The earnest and devout
            sought spiritual nourishment at conventicles and so-called
            <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=

            addressed by laymen, mostly of the working class, well acquainted
            with Scripture and works in practical divinity. Persecuted by the
            irreligious mob, the rationalist clergy, and sometimes by the
            authorities, they by-and-by secured representatives among the
            younger clergy and in the university chairs, and carried on
            vigorous missions at home and abroad. This pietism was distinctly
            evangelical and Protestant. It did not oppose but endeavoured
            simply to restore the orthodoxy of the church confession. Yet it
            had many of the characteristics of the earlier pietism:
            over-estimation of the invisible to the disparagement of the
            visible church, of sanctification over justification, a tendency
            to chiliasm, etc.—Of no less importance in awakening the
            religious life throughout Germany, and especially in Switzerland,
            was the missionary activity of Madame de Krüdener of Riga. This
            lady, after many years of a gay life, forsook the world, and
            began in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            of this world, and to kings and princes the majesty of Christ as
            King of kings. Wherever she went she made careless sinners
            tremble, and drew around her crowds of the anxious and
            spiritually burdened of every sort and station. Honoured by some
            as a saint, prophetess, and wonder-worker, ridiculed by others as
            a fool, persecuted as a dangerous fanatic or deceiver, driven
            from one country to another, she died in the Crimea in

            theosophist, J. H. Schönherr of Königsberg, starting from the two
            primitive substances, fire and water, developed a system of
            theosophy in which he solved the riddles of the theogony and
            cosmogony, of sin and redemption, and harmonized revelation with
            the results of natural science. At first influenced by these
            views, but from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1819 expressly
            dissenting from them, J. W. Ebel, pastor in the same city,
            gathered round him a group of earnest Christian men and women,
            Counts Kanitz and Finkenstein and their wives, Von Tippelskirch,
            afterwards preacher to the embassy at Rome, the theological
            professor <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page177">[pg

            H. Olshausen, the pastor Dr. Diestel, and the medical doctor
            Sachs. After some years Olshausen and Tippelskirch withdrew, and
            dissensions arose which gave opportunity to the ecclesiastical
            authorities to order an investigation. Ebel was charged with
            founding a sect in which impure practices were encouraged. He was
            suspended in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1835, and at the
            instigation of the consistory a criminal process was entered upon
            against him. Dr. Sachs, who had been expelled from the society,
            was the chief and almost only witness, but vague rumours were
            rife about mystic rites and midnight orgies. Ebel and Diestel
            were deposed in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1839, and
            pronounced incapable of holding any public office; and as a sect
            founder Ebel was sentenced to imprisonment in the common jail. On
            appeal to the court of Berlin, the deposition was confirmed, but
            all the rest of the sentence was quashed, and the parties were
            pronounced capable of holding any public offices except those of
            a spiritual kind. Two reasons were alleged for deposition: (1)
            That Ebel, though not from the pulpit or in the public
            instruction of the young, yet in private religious teaching, had
            inculcated his theosophical views. (2) That both of them as
            married men had given expression to opinions injurious to the
            purity of married life. In general they were charged with
            spreading a doctrine which was in conflict with the principles of
            Christianity, and making such use of sexual relations as was
            fitted to awaken evil thoughts in the minds of hearers. Ebel was
            pronounced guiltless of sectarianism.—Kanitz wrote a book in
            defence, which represents Ebel and Diestel as martyrs to their
            pure Christian piety in an age hostile to every pietistic
            movement; whereas Von Wegnern, followed by Hepworth Dixon, in a
            romancing and frivolous style, lightly give currency to evil
            surmisings without offering any solid basis of proof. The whole
            affair still waits for a patient and unprejudiced
            investigation.<a id="noteref_84" name="noteref_84" href=

            1883, Prof. Bender of Bonn declared that in the confessional
            writings of the Reformation evangelical truth had been obscured
            by Romish scholasticism, introduced by subtle jurists and
            sophistical theologians. This called forth vigorous opposition,
            in which two of his colleagues, 38 theological students, 59
            members of the Rhenish synod, took part. General-Superintendent
            Baur, also, in a new year's address, inveighed against Bender's
            statements. On the other hand, 170 students of Bonn, 32 of these
            theological students, gave a grand ovation to the <span class=

            Rhenish and Westphalian synods bewailed the offence given by

            the confessional writings. At the Westphalian synod, Prof.
            Mangold said that the faculty was as much offended at the address
            as the church had been, but that its author, when he found how
            his words had created such feeling, sought in every way to
            repress the agitation, and had intended only to pass a scientific
            judgment on ecclesiastical and theological developments.</p>

            favoured and furthered the scheme for union between the two
            evangelical churches, and over this question a split arose in the
            camp of pietism. On the one hand were the confessionalists,
            determined to maintain what was distinctive in their symbols, and
            on the other, those who would sacrifice almost anything for
            union. For the most part both churches cordially seconded the
            efforts of the royal head of the church; only in Silesia did a
            Lutheran minority refuse to give way, which still maintains a
            separate existence.</p>

            the Lutheran and in the Reformed church comparatively little
            stress was laid upon distinctive confessional doctrines, and
            pietism and rationalism, for different reasons, had taught the
            relative unimportance of dogma. And so a general accord was given
            to the king's proposal, at the Reformation centenary of
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            preparation of which the pious king, Frederick William III., had
            himself taken part, was indeed condemned by many as too
            high-church, even Catholicizing in its tendency. A revised
            edition in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1829, giving a
            wider choice of formularies, was legally authorized, and the
            union became an accomplished fact. There now existed in Prussia
            an evangelical national church with a common government and
            liturgy, embracing within it three different sections: a
            Lutheran, and a Reformed, which held to their distinctive
            doctrines, though not regarding these as a cause of separation,
            and a real union party, which completely abandoned the points of
            difference. But more and more the union became identified with
            doctrinal indifferentism and slighting of all church symbols, and
            those in whom the church feeling still prevailed were driven into
            opposition to the union (<a href="#Section_193" class=

            the union denied that there was any passing over from one church
            to another, it practically declared the distinctive doctrines to
            be unessential, and so assumed the standpoint of the Reformed
            church. Steffens (<a href="#Section_174_Para_3" class=

            separations were prevented by timely concessions on the part of
            the national church. The separatists claim 50,000 members, with

            Lutherans, especially over the question of the visible church.
            The majority, headed by Huschke, defined the visible church as an
            organism of various offices and orders embracing even
            unbelievers, which is to be sifted by the divine judgment. To it
            belongs the office of church government, which is a <span lang=

            the preaching of the word and dispensation of sacraments, and
            held that unbelievers belonged as little to the visible as to the
            invisible church. The distribution of orders and offices is a
            merely human arrangement without divine appointment, individual
            members are quite independent of one another, the church
            recognises no other government than that of the unfettered
            preaching of the word, and each pastor rules in his own
            congregation. Diedrich of Jabel and seven other pastors

            at a yet more comprehensive confederation of all Protestant

            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1846. Its object
            was the fraternizing of all evangelical Christians on the basis
            of agreement upon the fundamental truths of salvation, the
            vindication and spread of this common faith, and contention for
            liberty of conscience and religious toleration. Nine articles
            were laid down as terms of membership: Belief in the inspiration
            of Scripture, in the Trinity, in the divinity of Christ, in
            original sin, in justification by faith alone, in the
            obligatoriness of the two sacraments, in the resurrection of the
            body, in the last judgment, and in the eternal blessedness of the
            righteous and the eternal condemnation of the ungodly. It could
            thus include Baptists, but not Quakers. In <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1855 it held its
            ninth meeting at the great Paris Industrial Exhibition as a sort
            of church exhibition, the representatives of different churches
            reporting on the condition of their several denominations. The
            tenth meeting, of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1857, was held in
            Berlin. The council of the Alliance, presided over by Sir Culling
            Eardley, presented an address to King Frederick William IV., in
            which it was said that they aimed a blow not only against the
            sadduceanism, but also against the pharisaism of the German
            evangelical church. The confessional Lutherans, who had opposed
            the Alliance, regarded this latter reference as directed against
            them. The king, however, received the deputation most graciously,
            while declaring that he entertained the brightest hopes for the
            future of the church, and urged cordial brotherly love among
            Christians. Though many distinguished confessionalists were
            members of the Alliance none of them put in an appearance. The
            members of the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Protestantenverein”</span> (<a href="#Section_180"
            class="tei tei-ref">§ 180</a>) would not take part because the
            articles were too orthodox. On the other hand, numerous
            representatives of pietism, unionism, Melanchthonianism, as well
            as Baptists, Methodists, and Moravians, crowded in from all
            parts, and were supported by the leading liberals in church and
            state. While there was endless talk about the oneness and
            differences of the children of God, about the universal
            priesthood, about the superiority of the present meeting over the
            œcumenical councils of the ancient church, about the want of
            spiritual life in the churches, even where the theology of the
            confessions was professed, etc., with denunciations of
            half-Catholic Lutheranism and its sacramentarianism and
            officialism, and many a true and admirable statement of what the
            church's needs are, Merle d'Aubigné introduced discord by the
            hearty welcome which he accorded his friend Bunsen, which was
            intensified by the passionate manner in <span class="tei tei-pb"

            gracious royal reception of the members of the Alliance, at which
            Krummacher gave expression to his excited feelings in the words,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Your Majesty, we would all fall not at
            your feet, but on your neck!”</span> was described by his
            brother, Dr. F. W. Krummacher, as a sensible prelude to the
            solemn scenes of the last judgment. Sir Culling Eardley declared,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“There is no more the North Sea.”</span>
            Lord Shaftesbury said in London that with the Berlin Assembly a
            new era had begun in the world's history; and others who had
            returned from it extolled it as a second Pentecost.</p>

            Silesia. The Lutheran congress, held shortly before at Leipzig
            under the presidency of Harless, had pronounced the confederation
            unsatisfactory. The political reaction in favour of the church
            had also taken away the occasion for such a confederation. Yet
            the yearly deliberations of this council on matters of practical
            church life did good service. An attempt made at the Berlin
            meeting of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            violent debates on foreign missions and evangelical Catholicity
            between the representatives of confessional Lutheranism who had
            hitherto maintained connection with the confederation and the
            unionist majority. The Lutherans now withdrew. The attempt made

            Warneck, etc., and liberal theologians like Lipsius and Nippold
            of Jena, etc.; and it soon received the addition of about 250
            names. It recognised Jesus Christ, as the only begotten Son of
            God, as the only means of salvation, and professed the
            fundamental doctrines of the Reformation. It represented the task
            of the League as twofold: on the one hand the defending at all
            points the interests of the evangelical church against the
            advancing pretensions of Rome, and, on the other hand, the
            strengthening of the communal consciousness of the Christian
            evangelical church against the cramping influence of party, as
            well as in opposition to indifferentism and materialism. For the
            accomplishment of this task the league organized itself under the
            control of a central board with subordinate branches over all
            Germany, each having a committee for representing its interests
            in the press, and with annual general assemblies of all the

            urged the duty of firmly maintaining doctrinal unity in the
            Lutheran church. The assembly of the following year agreed to
            recognise the emperor as head of the church only in so far as he
            did not interfere with the dispensation of word and sacrament,
            admitted the legality of a merely civil marriage but maintained
            that despisers of the ecclesiastical ordinance should be
            subjected to discipline, that communion fellowship is to be
            allowed neither to Reformed nor unionists if fixed residents, but
            to unionists faithful to the confession if temporary residents,
            even without expressly joining their party; and also with
            reference to the October assembly of the previous year the union
            of the two Protestant churches of Germany under a mixed system of
            church government was condemned. The third general conference of

            the questions: Whether the church should be under State control
            or free? Whether the schools should be denominational or not? and

            maintained a position midway between Lutheranism and Calvinism
            very similar to the later Melanchthonianism. Ebrard indeed sought
            to prove that strict predestinarianism was only an excrescence of
            the Reformed system, whereas Schweitzer, purely in the interests
            of science (§ 182, <a href="#Section_182_Para_9" class=

            nerve and centre, to which it owes its wonderful vitality, force,
            and consistency. Heppe of Marburg went still further than Ebrard
            in his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page185">[pg

            original evangelical church of Germany was Melanchthonian, that
            after Luther's death the fanatics, more Lutheran than Luther,
            founded the so-called Lutheran church and completed it by issuing
            the Formula of Concord; that the Calvinizing of the Palatinate,
            Hesse, Brandenburg, Anhalt was only a reaction against hyper- or
            pseudo-Lutheranism, and that the restoration of the original
            Melanchthonianism, and the modern union movement were only the
            completion of that restoration. Schenkel's earlier contributions
            to Reformation history moved in a similar direction. Ebrard also,
            in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            G. D. Krummacher, from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1816 pastor in
            Elberfeld, and his nephew F. W. Krummacher of Barmen, were long
            its chief representatives. When Prussia sought in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1835 to force the
            union in the Wupperthal, and threatened the opposing Reformed
            pastors with deposition, the revolt here proved almost as serious
            as that of the Lutherans in Silesia. The pastors, with the
            majority of their people agreed at last to the union only in so
            far as it was in accordance with the Reformed mode of worship.
            But a portion, embracing their most important members, stood
            apart and refused all conciliation. The royal Toleration Act of
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1847 allowed them
            to form an independent congregation at Elberfeld with Dr.
            Kohlbrügge as their minister. This divine, formerly Lutheran
            pastor at Amsterdam, was driven out owing to a contest with a
            rationalising colleague, and afterwards, through study of
            Calvin's writings, became an ardent Calvinist. This body, under
            the name of the Dutch Reformed church, constituted the one
            anti-unionist, strictly Calvinistic denomination in Prussia.—The
            De Cock movement (<a href="#Section_200_Para_2" class=

            there of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Old Ref. Church of East
            Frisia and Bentheim,”</span> which has now nine congregations and
            seven pastors.—At the meeting of the Evangelical Alliance in New
            York in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            Presbyterians present resolved to convoke an œcumenical Reformed
            council. A conference in London in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1875 brought to
            maturity the idea of a Pan-Presbyterian assembly. The council is
            to meet every third year; the members recognise the supreme
            authority of the Old and New Testament in matters of faith and
            practice, and accept the consensus of all the Reformed
            confessions. The first <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class=

            that it represented forty millions of Presbyterians. It appointed
            a committee to draw up a consensus of the confessions of all
            Reformed churches. The third council of 305 members met at
            Belfast in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1884, and after a
            long debate declined, by a great majority, to adopt a strictly
            formulated consensus of doctrine as uncalled for and undesirable,
            and by the reception of the Cumberland Presbyterians they even
            surrendered the Westminster Confession (<a href=

            itself satisfied with Ziegler's promise to take unconditionally

            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Berlin</span></em> were specially sharp. In
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1872 the aged
            pastor of the so called New Church, Dr. <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Sydow</span></em>, delivered a lecture on
            the miraculous birth of Jesus, in which he declared that he was
            the legitimate son of Joseph and Mary. His colleague, Dr.
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Lisco</span></em>, son of the well-known
            commentator, spoke of legendary elements in the Apostles' Creed,
            and denied its authority. Lisco was reprimanded and cautioned by
            the consistory. Sydow was deposed. He appealed, together with
            twenty-six clergymen of the province of Brandenburg, and twelve
            Berlin pastors, to the Supreme Church Council. The Jena
            theologians also presented a largely signed petition to Dr. Falk
            against the procedure of the consistory, while the Weimar and
            Württemberg clergy sent a petition in favour of maintaining
            strict discipline. The superior court reversed the sentence, on
            the ground that the lecture was not given in the exercise of his
            office, and severely reprimanded Sydow for giving serious offence
            by its public delivery. At a Berlin provincial synod in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1877, an attack was
            made by pastor <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Hossbach</span></em>, preaching in a vacant
            church, declared that he repudiated the confessional doctrine of
            the divinity of Christ, regarded the life of Jesus in the gospels
            as a congeries of myths, etc. Some loudly protested and others as
            eagerly pressed for his settlement. The consistory accepted
            Rhode's retractation and annulled Hossbach's call. The Supreme
            Church Council supported the consistory, and issued a strict
            order to its president to suffer no departure from the
            confession. The congregation next chose Dr. <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Schramm</span></em>, a pronounced adherent
            of the same party, who was also rejected. In <span class=

            regarding Scripture, the divinity and resurrection of Christ, and
            the Apostles Creed, and on receiving his reply summoned him to a
            conference at Berlin, he resigned his office.</p>

            conflicts in Schleswig Holstein also caused considerable
            excitement. Pastor <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            published an article at Easter, <span class=

            which the resurrection was made purely spiritual. He was charged
            with violating his ordination vow, sectaries pointed to his paper
            as proof of their theory that the state church was the
            apocalyptic Babylon, and petitions from 115 ministers and 2,500
            laymen were presented against him to the consistory of Kiel. The
            consistory exhorted Kühl to be more careful and his opponents to
            be more patient. In the same year, however, he published a paper
            in which he denied that the order of nature was set aside by
            miracles. He was now advised to give up writing and confine
            himself to his pastoral work. A pamphlet by Decker on
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The Old Faith and the New,”</span> was

            with the ordination vow was of such a kind as to lead pastor
            Paulsen to speak of it as a <span class=

            incapable of answering to the Christian needs and ecclesiastical
            tastes of the nineteenth century. Whenever there was a revival in
            favour of the faith of their fathers, a movement was made in the
            direction of improved forms of worship. The Rationalists and
            Friends of Light, however, prevented progress except in a few
            states. Even the official Eisenach Conference did no more than
            prepare the way and indicate how action might afterwards be
            taken.</p>

            enter the lists as a restorer; and various attempts were made by
            Von Elsner, Von Raumer, Bunsen, Stier, Knapp, <span class=

            collections of sacred songs answerable to the revived Christian
            sentiment of the people. These came to be largely used, not in
            the public services, but in family worship, and prepared the way
            for official revisal of the books for church use. The Eisenach
            Conference of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            the chorale to its former position, and he was followed by the
            jurist Thibaut, whose work on <span class="tei tei-q">“The Purity
            of Tone”</span> has been translated into English. The reform of
            the chorale was carried out most vigorously in Württemberg, but
            it was in Bavaria that the old chorale in its primitive
            simplicity was most widely introduced.</p>

            hymns. The Lutherans now went back to the old Reformation models,
            and liturgical services, with musical performances, became
            popular in Berlin. Conferences held at Dresden did much for
            liturgical reform, and the able works and collections of
            Schöberlein supplied abundant materials for the practical
            carrying out of the movement.</p>

            Bible in its fifth edition adopted somewhat advanced views on
            inspiration, the canon and authenticity, while maintaining
            generally the standpoint of the most reverent and pious students
            of scripture. Bunsen's commentary assumed a <span class=

            "tei tei-q">“Protestant Bible”</span> on the New Testament,
            translated into English, that of the advanced school. Besser's
            expositions of the New Testament books, of which we have in
            English those on John's gospel, had an unexampled popularity. The
            Eisenach Conference undertook a revision of Luther's translation
            of the Bible. The revised New Testament was published in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1870, and accepted
            by some Bible societies. The much more difficult task of Old
            Testament revision was entrusted to a committee of distinguished

            England, in May, 1885, the work of revision of the English
            version of the Bible, undertaken by order of convocation, was
            completed after fifteen years' labour, and issued jointly by the
            two universities of Oxford and Cambridge. The revised New
            Testament, prepared four years previously, had been telegraphed
            in short sections to America by the representative of the
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">New

            rather earlier than in England. But in the case of the Old
            Testament revision such freebooting industry was prevented by the
            strict and careful reserve of all concerned in the work. The
            revised New Testament had meanwhile never been introduced into
            the public services; whether the completed Bible will ever
            succeed in overcoming this prejudice remains to be seen.<a id=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The real
            founder of modern Protestant theology, the Origen of the
            nineteenth century, is Schleiermacher. His influence was so
            powerful and manysided that it extended not merely to his own
            school, but also in almost all directions, even to the Catholic
            church, embracing destructive and constructive tendencies such as
            appeared before in Origen and Erigena. Alongside of the vulgar
            rationalism, which still had notable representatives, De Wette
            founded the new school of historico-critical rationalism, and
            Neander that of pietistic supernaturalism, which soon
            overshadowed the two older schools of rational and supra-rational
            supernaturalism. On the basis of Schelling's and Hegel's
            philosophy Daub founded the school of speculative theology with
            an evangelical tendency; but after Hegel's death it split into a
            right <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page192">[pg
            192]</span><a name="Pg192" id="Pg192" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            and left wing. As the former could not maintain its position, its
            adherents by-and-by went over to other schools; and the latter,
            setting aside speculation and dogmatics, applied itself to the
            critical investigation of the early history of Christianity, and
            founded the school of Baur at Tübingen. Schleiermacher's school
            also split into a right and left wing. Each of them took the
            union as its standard; but the right, which claimed to be the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“German”</span> and the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Modern”</span> theology, wished a union under a
            consensus of the confessions, and sought to effect an
            accommodation between the old faith and the modern liberalism;
            whereas the left wished union without a confession, and
            unconditioned toleration of <span class="tei tei-q">“free
            science.”</span> This latter tendency, however, secured greater
            prominence and importance from <span class=

            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1854, through
            combination with the representatives of the historico-critical
            and the younger generation of the Baurian school, from which
            originated the <span class="tei tei-q">“free Protestant”</span>
            theology. On the other hand, under the influence of pietism,
            there has arisen since <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1830, especially in
            the universities of Erlangen, Leipzig, Rostock, and Dorpat, a
            Lutheran confessional school, which seeks to develop a Lutheran
            system of theology of the type of Gerhard and Bengel. A similar
            tendency has also shown itself in the Reformed church. The most
            recent theological school is that founded by Ritschl, resting on
            a Lutheran basis but regarded by the confessionalists as rather
            allied to the <span class="tei tei-q">“free Protestant”</span>
            theology, on account of its free treatment of certain fundamental
            doctrines of Lutheranism.—Theological contributions from
            Scandinavia, England, and Holland are largely indebted to German
            theology.</p>

            domination, went in the same year to Berlin, where by speech and
            writing he sought to arouse German patriotism. There he was
            appointed preacher in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            five <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="de" class=

            "font-style: italic">Reden über d.
            Religion</span></span>.”</span> In these it was not biblical and
            still less ecclesiastical Christianity which he sought with
            glowing eloquence to address to the hearts of the German people,
            but Spinozist pantheism. The fundamental idea of his life, that
            God, <span class="tei tei-q">“the absolute unity,”</span> cannot
            be reached in thought nor grasped by will, but only embraced in
            feeling as immediate consciousness, and hence that feeling is the
            proper seat of religion, appears already in his early productions
            as the centre of his system. In the following year, <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1800, he set forth
            his ethical theory in five <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Monologues”</span>: every man should in his own way
            represent humanity in a special blending of its elements. The
            study and translation of Plato, which occupied him now for
            several years, exercised a powerful influence upon him. He
            approached more and more towards positive Christianity. In a
            Christmas Address in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1803 on the model
            of Plato's Symposium, he represents Christ as the divine object
            of all faith. In <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1811 he published
            his <span class="tei tei-q">“Short Outline of Theological
            Study,”</span> which has been translated into English, a masterly
            sketch of theological encyclopædia. In <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1821 he produced
            his great masterpiece, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="de"
            class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Der Chr. Glaube</span></span>,”</span> which
            makes feeling the seat of all religion as immediate consciousness
            of absolute dependence, perfectly expressed in Jesus Christ,
            whose life redeems the world. The task of dogmatics is to give
            scientific expression to the Christian consciousness as seen the
            life of the redeemed; it has not to prove, but only to work out
            and exhibit in relation to the whole spiritual life what is
            already present as a fact of experience. Thus dogmatics and
            philosophy are quite distinct. He proves the evangelical
            Protestant character of the doctrines thus developed by
            quotations from the consensus of both confessions.
            Notwithstanding his protest, many of his contemporaries still
            found remnants of Spinozist pantheism. On certain points too, he
            failed to satisfy the claims of orthodoxy; <span class=

            all advances from philosophy and theology, science and national
            literature. The new school of historico-critical rationalism
            availed itself of every aid in the direction of scientific

            was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">De
            Wette</span></em>; a contemporary of Schleiermacher in Berlin
            University, but deprived of office in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1819 for sending a
            letter of condolence to the mother of Sands, which was regarded
            as an apology for his crime. From <span class=

            in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1849 he continued
            to work unweariedly in Basel. His theological position had its
            starting point in the philosophy of his friend Fries, which he
            faithfully adhered to down to the end of his life. His friendship
            with Schleiermacher had also a powerful influence upon him. He
            too placed religion essentially in feeling, which, however, he
            associated much more closely with knowledge and will. In the
            church doctrines he recognised an important symbolical expression
            of religious truths, and so by the out and out rationalist he was
            all along sneered at as a mystic. But his chief strength lay in
            the sharp critical treatment which he gave to the biblical canon
            and the history of the O.T. and N.T. His commentaries on the
            whole of the N.T. are of permanent value, and contain his latest
            thoughts, when he had approached most nearly to positive
            Christianity. His literary career began in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1806 with a
            critical examination of the books of Chronicles. He also wrote on
            the Psalms, on Jewish history, on Jewish archæology, and made a
            new translation of the Bible. His Introductions to the O.T. and
            N.T. have been translated into English.—<em class=

            exercised an influence such as no other theological teacher had
            exerted since Luther and Melanchthon. Adopting Schleiermacher's
            standpoint, he regarded religion as a matter of feeling:
            <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "la"><span style="font-style: italic">Pectus est quod theologum

            became the father of modern scientific pietism, but it
            incapacitated him from understanding the longing of the age for
            the restoration of a firm objective basis for the faith. He was
            adverse to the Hegelian philosophy no less than to
            confessionalism. Neander was so completely a pectoralist, that
            even his criticism was dominated by feeling, as seen in his
            vacillations on questions of N.T. authenticity and historicity.
            His <span class="tei tei-q">“Church History,”</span> of which we

            afterwards confessed that these studies had helped to draw him
            into close sympathy with confessionalism. While always lax in his
            views of authenticity, he came to adopt a very decided position
            in regard to revelation and inspiration.—<em class=

            determined by innumerable controversies, in none of which he
            abated a single hair's breadth, he looked askance at science as a
            gift of the Danaides, and set forth in opposition to rationalism
            and naturalism a system of theology unmodified by all the
            theories of modern times. Born in the Reformed church and in his
            understanding of Scripture always more Calvinist than Lutheran,
            rationalising only upon miracles that seemed to detract from the
            dignity of God, and in his later years inclined to the Romish
            doctrine of justification, he may nevertheless claim to be
            classed among the confessionalists within the union. He deserves
            the credit of having given a great impulse to O.T. studies and a
            powerful defence of O.T. books, though often abandoning the
            position of an apologist for that of an advocate. His

            mainly to historical research about the beginnings of

            tendency of Schleiermacher, and, in a style far abler and subtler
            than any other modern theologian, expounded the Reformed system
            of doctrine in its rigid logical consistency. In his own system
            he gives a scientific exposition of the evangelical faith from
            the unionist standpoint, with many pious reflections on Scripture
            and the confession as well as results of Christian experience,

            1839, a work of careful historical research and theological
            speculation. The fundamental ideas of his Christology are the

            theology generally of the necessity of the incarnation even apart
            from sin (which Müller strongly opposed), and the notion of the
            archetypal Christ, the God-Man, as the collective sum of
            humanity, in whom <span class="tei tei-q">“are gathered the
            patterns of all several individualities.”</span> His <span class=

            copestone of an almost fifty years' academical career. Christ's

            ephorus at the preachers' seminary of Wittenberg, and afterwards
            professor in Bonn and Heidelberg. Rothe was one of the most
            profound thinkers of the century, equalled by none of his
            contemporaries in the grasp, depth, and originality of his
            speculation. Though influenced by Schleiermacher, Neander, and
            Hegel, he for a long time withdrew like an anchoret from the
            strife of theologians and philosophers, and took up a position
            alongside of Oetinger in the chamber of the theosophists. His
            mental and spiritual constitution had indeed much in common with
            that great mystic. In his first important work, <span class=

            in its perfected form the church becomes merged into the state.

            originality, and conclusiveness of reasoning is almost
            unapproached, and is full of the most profound Christian views in
            spite of its many heterodoxies. In his later years he took part

            1843 to Tübingen, where he opposed to the teaching of Baur's
            school a purely biblical and positive theology, with a success
            that exceeded all expectations. A Württemberger by birth, nature,
            and training, he quite ignored the history of the church and its
            dogmas as well as modern criticism, and set forth a system of
            theology drawn from a theosophical realistic study of the Bible.
            He took little interest in the excited movements of his age for
            home and foreign missions, union, confederation, and alliances,
            in questions about liturgies, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            divine institution, yet without adopting the Romanizing and
            Anglican theory of apostolic succession; and (2) On the more
            important question of biblical prophecy, where one party
            maintained the spiritualistic, widely favoured since the time of
            Jerome, and another party, attaching itself to Crusius and

            monotheistic Jehovism. Little success attended his efforts.
            Greater results were obtained by Reuss' two pupils, <em class=

            he gives expression with clearness and force to his radical
            negative criticism, and develops a purely naturalist conception
            of the Old Testament. Professor Kuenen of Leyden transplanted
            these views to the Netherlands, and Robertson Smith has
            introduced them into Scotland and England, while in Germany they
            are taught by a number of the younger teachers, Stade in Giessen,
            Merx in Heidelberg, Smend in Basel, etc. And now at last in

            xml:lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">Geschichte d. h.
            Schr. d. A. Test.</span></span>”</span> given a brilliant and in
            many points modified exposition of these radical theories. The
            history of Israel, according to him, divides itself into the four
            successive periods of the heroes, of the prophets, of the
            priests, and of the scribes, characterized respectively by
            individualism, idealism, formalism, and traditionalism. Even
            before the close of prophetism the priestly influence began to
            assert itself, but it was only in the post-exilian period under
            the domination of the priests that the construction and
            codification of the law began to make impression on the Jewish
            people. So too in the age of the kings there existed a Levitical
            tradition about rites and worship, which traced back its first
            outlines to the time of Moses, though at this period there could
            have been no written official codex of any kind. In regard to
            Moses, we are to think not only of his person as historical, but
            also of his career as that of a man inspired by the divine spirit
            and recognised as such by his contemporaries and
            fellow-countrymen.—Also <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            concerned himself only with the critical introduction to the Old

            admits that much of the history of Israel related in the Old
            Testament is credible. He even goes so far as to allow that this
            history was a preparation and forerunner of Christianity, but
            without miracle and prophecy, and without any immediate
            interposition of God in the affairs of Israel.</p>

            on his withdrawal from the Tübingen party, applied himself to
            dogmatic studies and founded a school, the adherents of which,
            divided into right and left wings, have secured quite a number of
            academical appointments. After the completion of his great
            dogmatic work on <span class="tei tei-q">“Justification and
            Reconciliation,”</span> Ritschl resumed his historical studies in
            a <span class="tei tei-q">“History of Pietism,”</span> which he
            traces back through the persecuted anabaptists of the Reformation
            age to the Tertiaries of the Franciscan order and the mysticism
            of St. Bernard. He earnestly maintains his adherence to the
            confessions of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page209">[pg
            209]</span><a name="Pg209" id="Pg209" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            the Lutheran church, and regards it as the task of his life to
            disentangle the pure Lutheran doctrine from the accretions of
            scholastic metaphysics. Even more decidedly than Schleiermacher,
            he banishes all philosophy from the domain of theology. The grand
            significance of Kant's doctrine of knowledge, with its assertion
            of the incomprehensibility of all transcendent truth except the
            ethical postulates of God, freedom and immortality, as set forth
            in a more profound manner by Lotze, is indeed admitted, but only
            as a methodological basis of all religious inquiries, and with
            determined rejection of every material support from Kant's
            construction of religion within the limits of the pure reason.
            Ritschl rather pronounces in favour of the formal principle of
            Protestantism, and declares distinctly that all religious truth
            must be drawn directly from Scripture, primarily from the New
            Testament as the witness of the early church uncorrupted by the
            Platonic-Aristotelian metaphysic, but also secondarily from the
            Old Testament as the record of the content of revelation made to
            the religious community of Israel. The truthfulness of the
            biblical, especially of the New Testament, system of truth,
            rests, however, not on any theory of inspiration, but on its
            being an authentic statement of the early church of the doctrine
            of Christ, inasmuch as to this witness the necessary degree of
            <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "la"><span style="font-style: italic">fides humana</span></span>
            belongs. Ritschl's Christology rests on the witness of Christ to
            himself in the synoptists, through which he proclaims himself the
            one prophet who in the divine purpose of grace for mankind has
            received perfect consecration, sent by God into the world to
            represent the founding of the kingdom of God on earth
            foreshadowed in the Old Testament revelation; but no attempt is
            made to explain how Christ became possessed of the secrets of the
            divine decree. To him, as the first and only begotten Son of God,
            standing in essential union with the Father, belongs the
            attribute of deity and the right of worship. But of an eternal
            preexistence of Christ we can speak only in so far as this is
            meant of the eternal gracious purpose of God to redeem the world
            through him by means of the complete unfolding of the kingdom of
            God in the fellowship of love. Whatever goes beyond this in the
            fourth gospel, its Johannine authenticity not being otherwise
            contested, as well as in Paul's epistles and in the Epistle to
            the Hebrews, resulted from the necessity felt by their writers
            for assigning a sufficient reason for the assumption of such
            incomparable glory on the part of Christ. As the archetype of
            humanity destined for the kingdom of God, Christ is the original
            object of the divine love, so that the love of God to the members
            of his kingdom comes to them only through him. And as the earthly
            founding, so also the heavenly completion, of the kingdom of God
            is assigned to Christ, and hence after his resurrection all power
            was given to him, of the transcendent exercise of which, however,
            we <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg 210]</span><a name=
            "Pg210" id="Pg210" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> can know nothing.
            The universality of human sin is admitted by Ritschl as a fact of
            experience, but he despairs of reaching any dogmatic statement as
            to the origin of sin through the temptation of a superhuman evil
            power. But that sin is inherited and as original guilt is under
            the condemnation of God, is not taught or pre-supposed by the
            teaching either of Christ or of the apostles. Redemption
            (reconciliation and justification) consists in the forgiveness of
            sins, by which the guilt that estranges from God is removed and
            the sinner is restored into the fellowship of the kingdom of God.
            Forgiveness, however, is not given on condition of the vicarious
            penal sufferings of Christ, whose sufferings and death are of
            significance rather because his life and works were a complete
            fulfilment of his calling, and witnessed to as such by God's
            raising him from the dead. Justification secures the reception of
            the penitent sinner into the fellowship of the kingdom of God,
            preached and perfectly developed by Christ, and the sonship
            enjoyed in its membership, prefigured in Christ himself, which
            contains in itself the desire as well as the capacity to do good
            works out of love to God.—The school of Ritschl is represented in

            Ritschl, especially from the confessional Lutheran ranks, have
            appeared in considerable numbers. Luthardt of Leipzig in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1878 opened the
            campaign against Ritschilianism, followed by Bestmann, charging
            it with undermining Christianity. The Hanoverian synod of
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1882 decided by a
            large majority that the scientific results of theological science
            must be ruled by the confessions of the evangelical church. The
            chief theme at the following Hanoverian Pentecost Conference was
            the <span class="tei tei-q">“Incarnation of the Son of
            God,”</span> the discussion being led by Professor Dieckhoff of
            Rostock, against whom no voice was raised in favour of the views
            of Ritschl. Not long after, Professor Fricke of Leipzig published
            a lecture given by him at the Meissen Conference, on the Present
            Relations of Metaphysics and Theology, followed by utterances of
            Kübel of Tübingen, Grau of Königsberg, Kreibig and H. Schmidt at
            Berlin, all unfavourable to Ritschl's theology.—The main
            objections are, according to <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Bestmann</span></em>:
            idolatry of Kant, depreciation of the religious factor in
            Christianity in favour of the ethical by laying out a moral
            foreground without providing a dogmatic background, reducing the
            objective fundamental truths of the confession into subjective
            ethical ideas, etc.; <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg

            that it does not matter so much what the facts of the Christian
            faith are in themselves, as what they mean for us, makes his
            whole dogmatic system hang in the air, if in Christianity we have
            to do not with what God, Christ, the resurrection are, but only
            what significance we attach to them, Christianity is stript of
            all importance, the significance of a thing must have its
            foundation in the thing itself, etc.; according to <em class=

            accepting the divinity of Christ lays down the rule that the
            special content of what is meant by the term divinity must be
            transferable to the believer, and so for Ritschl, Christ is a
            mere man who in his person was the first to represent a relation
            to God which is destined for all men in like measure, etc.;

            ground of justification, but only the means of revealing the
            eternal justifying will of God, and therefore finally a
            continuation of the historical work of Christ by means of his

            Schmidt express themselves in a similar manner.—Ritschl has not
            himself undertaken any reply, but his disciples have sought to
            remove what they regard as misunderstandings, and generally to
            vindicate the system of their master.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In regard to
            home mission work, the Protestant church long lagged behind the
            Catholic, which had wrought vigorously through its monkish
            orders. England first entered with zeal into the field,
            especially dissenters and members of the low church party, and
            subsequently also the high church ritualistic party (§ 202,
            <a href="#Section_202_Para_1" class="tei tei-ref">1</a>, <a href=
            "#Section_202_Para_3" class="tei tei-ref">3</a>), which now takes
            an active interest in this work. Germany, in view of the scanty
            means at the disposal of the pietists and the church party, made
            noble efforts. In other continental countries, but especially in
            North America, much was done for home missions. Soon the whole
            Protestant world began to organize benevolent and evangelistic
            institutions. The laborious Wichern, in <span class=

            all Germany to arouse interest in home missions, and started a
            yearly congress on the subject in Wittenberg. Till his death in

            his itinerant labours, and during the year formed more than a
            hundred groups of adherents over all Württemberg. His preaching
            was allegorical and eschatological, and avoided the doctrines of
            satisfaction and justification. On his repudiating the Augsburg
            Confession, the church boards refused to recognise him, and he
            went hither and thither preaching a Christian communism. In

            site in Reutlingen, built a house, and founded a school for
            eighty children. In order to develop his views of carrying on

            established no less than twenty-two branches, in which
            manufacturing was carried on, with institutions of all kinds for
            education, pastoral work, rescuing the lost and raising the
            fallen. Each member lives and works for the whole; none receives
            wages; surplus income goes to increase the number and extent of
            the institutions. Vast multitudes of sunken and destitute
            families have been by these means restored to respectable social
            positions and to a moral religious life.</p>

            societies constitute an independent branch of the home mission.
            Modern efforts to circulate Scripture began in England. As a
            necessary adjunct to missionary societies, the great British and
            Foreign Bible Society was founded in London in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1804, embracing all
            Protestant sects, excepting the Quakers. It circulates Bibles
            without note or comment. The Apocryphal controversy of
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1825-1827 resulted
            in the society resolving not to print the Apocrypha in its
            issues. In consequence of this decision, fifty German societies,
            including the present society of Berlin, seceded. The New York
            Association, founded in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1817, is in
            thorough accord with the London society. The Baden Missionary
            Society revived the discussion in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1852 by making it
            the subject of essay for a prize, which was won by the learned
            work of Keerl, who, along with the stricter Lutherans, condemned
            the Apocrypha. The other side was taken by Stier and
            Hengstenberg, and most of the consistories advised adherence to
            the old practice, as all misunderstanding was prevented by
            Luther's preface and the prohibition against using passages from
            the Apocrypha as sermon texts.—Bible societies altogether have
            issued during the century 180,000,000 Bibles and New Testaments

            most zealous in the cause of missions, and the Moravian Brethren
            have wrought most successfully in this department. The missions

            Wilberforce, unweariedly laboured for these ends.—Also in
            England, Germany, Russia, and France new associations were formed
            for missions to the Jews, and the work was carried on with

            epoch-making in the history of African missions. He got the
            greatest potentate in those regions, King Mtesa of Uganda, who
            had been converted by the Arabs to Mohammedanism, to adopt
            Christianity and permit a Christian church to be built in his
            city. Stanley's letters from Africa roused missionary fervour
            throughout England. The Church Missionary Society in <span class=

            mission station in the capital, and put a steamer on the Victoria
            Nyanza. The church services were regularly attended, education
            and the work of civilization zealously prosecuted, Sunday labour
            and the slave trade prohibited, etc. French Jesuits entered in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            suspicions of the English missionaries into the ear of the king,
            and the machinations of the Arab slave-dealers made their
            position dangerous. Missionaries arrived by way of Egypt with
            flattering recommendations from the English foreign secretary in
            the name of the queen. But the traders, by means of an Arabic
            translation of a letter purporting to be from the English consul
            at Zanzibar, cast suspicion on the document as a forgery, and
            represented its bearers as in the pay of the hostile Egyptians.
            Mtesa's wrath knew no bounds, and only his favour for the
            missionary physician saved the mission and led him to send an
            embassy of three chiefs and two missionaries to England in June,
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1879, to discover
            the actual truth. His anger meanwhile cooled, and the work of the
            mission was resumed. He was preparing to put an utter end to the
            national heathenism, when suddenly a report spread that the
            greatest of all the Lubaris or inferior deities, that of the
            Nyanza Lake, had become incarnate in an old woman, in order to
            heal the king and restore the ancient religion. The whole
            populace was in an uproar; <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page218">[pg 218]</span><a name="Pg218" id="Pg218" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> Mtesa, under threat of deposition, restored
            heathenism, with human sacrifice, man stealing, and the slave
            trade. Then the Lubari excitement cooled down. Mtesa, moved by a
            dream, declared himself again a Mohammedan, and converted the
            Christian church into a mosque. The English missionaries,
            stripped of all means, starved, and subjected to all sorts of
            privations, did not flinch. At last, in January, <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1881, the embassy,
            sent eighteen months before to England, reached home again, and,
            by the story of their reception, caused a revulsion of feeling in
            favour of the English mission, which again flourished under the
            protection of the king. But Mtesa died in 1884. His son and
            successor, Mwanga, a suspicious, peevish young despot, addicted
            to all forms of vice, began again the most cruel persecution, of
            which Bishop Hannington, sent out from England, with fifty
            companions, were the victims. Only four escaped.</p>

            there had great difficulties to contend against: the system of
            caste distinctions, the proud self-sufficiency of the pantheistic
            Brahmans, the politico-commercial interests of the East India
            Company, etc. The Leipzig Society has sixteen stations among the
            Tamuls, and alongside are English, American, and German
            missionaries of every school. The Gossner Society works among the
            Kohls of Chota Nagpore, where a rival mission has been started by
            the puseyite bishop of Calcutta, Dr. Milman, to which, in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            resumed with great vigour. The Christian benevolence shown during

            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1878, in which
            three millions perished, made a great impression in favour of the
            Protestant church. In the preceding years throughout all India
            only between 5,000 and 10,000 souls were annually added; but in

            compulsion was removed under British rule, this sham profession
            was at an end. Multitudes fell back into heathenism, and in the
            first ten years of the British dominion 900 new idol temples were
            erected. From <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            Christian congregations of old standing, greatly deteriorated for
            want of pastoral care, but still using the Heidelberg Catechism.

            began in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            London Missionary Society settled Morrison in Canton, where he
            began the study of the language and the translation of the Bible.
            Gutzlaff of Pomerania, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1826, conceived the
            plan of evangelizing China through the Chinese converts, but,

            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1854, the scheme
            failed through the unworthiness of many of the professors. The
            war against the opium traffic, <span class=

            five ports to the mission, and led to the transference of
            Hongkong to the English. The Chinese mission now made rapid
            strides; but the interior was still untouched. The conflict
            between the governor of Canton and the English, French, and
            Americans, and the chastisement administered to the Chinese in

            treaty with the three powers and also with Russia, by which the
            whole land was opened up for trade and missions, and full
            toleration granted to Christianity. Popular hatred of strangers,
            and especially of missionaries, however, occasioned frequently
            bloody encounters, and in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            than five millions perished, the heroic and self-sacrificing
            conduct of the missionaries brought them into high favour.
            Throughout China there are now 320 organized Christian
            congregations with 50,000 adherents under 238 foreign
            missionaries.—After seclusion for three centuries, <em class=

            so-called Daimios. In <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1871 the mikado's
            government succeeded in overcoming completely the power of the
            daimios and setting aside the shiogun or military vizier, who had
            exercised supreme executive power. European customs were
            introduced, but the rigorous enactments against native converts
            to Christianity were still enforced. A cruel persecution of
            native Christians was carried on in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1867, but the
            Protestant missionaries continued to work unweariedly, preparing
            dictionaries and reading books. The Buddhist <span class=

            rival mission to send agents to America and Europe, whereas many
            of the leading newspapers expressed the opinion that Japan must

            attack the defenceless people, proclaimed a French protectorate,
            and introduced not only Catholic missionaries, but European
            vices. Amid much persecution, however, the Protestants held their
            own. In December, 1880, Pomare V. resigned, and the Society
            Islands became a dependency of France.—In the south-east groups
            great opposition was shown, but in the north-west Christianity
            made rapid progress. The island of Raiatea was the centre of the

            tracts, and by the sending out of missionaries, mostly Jewish
            converts, the work was persevered in amid many discouragements.

            again Prussia's turn to make an appointment. The English demand
            to have Lutheran ministers ordained successively deacon,
            presbyter, and bishop had given offence, and so no new
            appointment has been made. In June 1886 the English-Prussian
            compact was formally cancelled and a proposal made to found an
            independent Prussian Evangelical bishopric.</p>

            clergy were favourable, but as the work progressed they became
            actively hostile, and only two mission schools in Syra and Athens
            were allowed to continue. In Syria the Americans made Beyrout

            afterwards abandoned for want of success. Down to the outbreak of

            patriarch excited a violent persecution which threatened the
            utter overthrow of the work. The British ambassador, Sir
            Stratford de Redcliffe, however, insisted upon the Porte
            recognising the rights of the Protestant Armenians as an
            independent religious denomination, and since then the missions
            have prospered. Among the Nestorians in Turkey and Persia the
            Americans, with Dr. Grant at their head, began operations in

            annihilated the Protestant missions among them. Operations,
            however, have been recommenced with encouraging success. Among
            the deeply degraded Copts in Egypt, and extending from them into
            Abyssinia, the Moravians had been working without any apparent

            Missionary Society, under German missionaries trained at Basel
            (Gobat, Irenberg, Krapf, etc.), took up the work, till it was

            missionaries began again to work in Abyssinia with the approval
            of King Theodore. This state of things soon changed. Theodore's
            ambition was to conquer Egypt and overthrow Islam. But when in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1863 this scheme
            only called forth threats from London and Paris, he gave loose
            rein to his natural ferocity and put the English consul and the
            German missionaries in chains. By means of an armed expedition in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            end to his own life. After the withdrawal of the English the

            reaction generally by-and-by put the church in a position as good

            threatening attitude of Austria, hastened to take Rome and
            restore the temporal power of the pope. Amid the convulsions of

            maintained by French and Austrian bayonets. Abandoning his
            liberal views, the pope now put himself more and more under the
            influence of the Jesuits, and his absolutist and reactionary
            politics were directed by Card. Antonelli. From his exile at
            Gaeta he had asked the opinion of the bishops of the whole church
            regarding the immaculate conception of the blessed Virgin, to
            whose protection he believed that he owed his safety. The
            opinions of 576 were favourable, resting on Bible proofs: Genesis
            iii. 15, Song of Sol. iv. 7, 12, and Luke i. 28; but some French
            and German bishops were strongly opposed. The question was now
            submitted for further consideration to various congregations, and
            finally the consenting bishops were invited to Rome to settle the
            terms of the doctrinal definition of the new dogma. After four
            secret sessions it was acknowledged by acclamation, and on 8th
            December, 1854 (§ 104, 7), the pope read in the Sixtine chapel
            the bull <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "la"><span style="font-style: italic">Ineffabilis</span></span>
            and placed a brilliant diadem on the head of the image of the
            queen of heaven. The disciples of St. Thomas listened in silence
            to this aspersion of their master's orthodoxy; no heed was paid
            to two isolated individual voices that protested; the bishops of
            all Catholic lands proclaimed the new dogma, the theologians
            vindicated it, and the spectacle-loving people rejoiced in the
            pompous Mary-festival. The pope's next great performance was the
            encyclical, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "la"><span style="font-style: italic">Quanta cura</span></span>,
            of December 8th, 1864, and the accompanying syllabus cataloguing
            in eighty-four propositions all the errors of the day, by which
            not only the antichristian and anti-ecclesiastical tendencies,
            but also claims for freedom of belief and worship, liberty of the
            press and science, the state's independence of the church, the
            equality of the laity and clergy in civil matters, in short all
            the principles of modern political and social life, were
            condemned as heretical. Three years later the centenary of Peter
            (§ 16, 1) brought five hundred bishops to Rome, with other clergy
            and laymen from all lands. The enthusiasm for the papal chair was
            such that the pope was encouraged to convoke an œcumenical
            council. The jubilee of his consecration as priest in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1869 brought him
            congratulatory addresses signed by one and a half millions,
            filled the papal coffers, attracted an immense number of visitors
            to Rome, and secured to all the votaries gathered there a
            complete indulgence. On the Vatican Council which met during that

            put an end to the short Austro-French war in Italy, a
            confederation was arranged of all the Italian princes under the
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page226">[pg 226]</span><a name=

            presidency of the pope for drawing up the future constitution of
            Italy. During the war the Austrians had vacated Bologna, but the
            French remained in Rome to protect the pope. The revolution now
            broke out in Romagna. Victor Emanuel, king of Sardinia, was
            proclaimed dictator for the time over that part of the Papal
            States and a provisional government was set up. In vain did the
            pope remind Christendom in an encyclical of the necessity of
            maintaining his temporal power, in vain did he thunder his

            xml:lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">Le Pope et le

            the pope's sovereignty to Rome and its neighbourhood, levy a tax
            for the support of the papal court on all Catholic nations, and
            leave Rome undisturbed by political troubles. On December 31st,
            1859, Napoleon III. exhorted the pope to yield to the logic of
            facts and to surrender the provinces that refused any longer to
            be his. The pope then issued a rescript in which he declared that
            he could never give up what belonged not to him but to the
            church. The popular vote in Romagna went almost unanimously for
            annexation to Sardinia, and this, in spite of the papal ban, was
            done. A revolution broke out in Umbria and the March of Ancona,
            and Victor Emanuel without more ado attached these states also to
            his dominion in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1860, so that only
            Rome and the Campagna were retained by the pope, and even these
            only by means of French support. At the September convention of
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1864 Italy
            undertook to maintain the papal domain intact, to permit the
            organization of an independent papal army, and to contribute to
            the papal treasury; while France was to quit Roman territory
            within at the latest two years. The pope submitted to what he
            could not prevent, but still insisted upon his most extreme
            claims, answered every attempt at conciliation with his
            stereotyped <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=

            party thought the time had come for freeing Italy from papal
            rule, and roused the whole land by public proclamation. Garibaldi
            again put himself at the head of the movement. The Papal State
            was soon encircled by bands of volunteers, and insurrections
            broke out even within Rome itself. Napoleon pronounced this a
            breach of the September convention, and in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1867 the volunteers
            were utterly routed by the French at Mentana. The French guarded
            Civita Vecchia and fortified Rome. But in August, 1870, their own
            national exigencies demanded the withdrawal of the French troops,
            and after the battle of Sedan the Italians to a man insisted on
            having Rome as their capital, and Victor Emanuel acquiesced.

            of the populace the Italian troops entered on September 20th,
            1870. A plebiscite in the papal dominions gave 133,681 votes in
            favour of annexation and 1,507 against; in Rome alone there were
            40,785 for and only 46 against. The king now issued the decree of
            incorporation; Rome became capital of united Italy and the

            every year returned the dotation as an insult and injury, and

            disciple whom Jesus loved that he would not die, so was it once

            prophecies not only against the Italian, but also against foreign
            states, for with most of them he lived in open war. A collection
            of his <span class="tei tei-q">“Speeches delivered at the

            in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            proclaimed on February 20th, 1878, as Leo XIII. In autograph
            letters he intimated his accession to the German and Russian
            emperors, but not to the king of Italy, and expressed his wish
            for a good mutual understanding. To the government of the Swiss
            Cantons he declared his hope that their ancient friendly
            relations might be restored. At Easter, 1878, he issued an
            encyclical to all patriarchs, primates, archbishops, and bishops,
            in which he required of them that they should earnestly entreat
            the mediation of the <span class="tei tei-q">“immaculate queen of

            make prominent the infallibility of the apostolic chair, and to
            condemn all the errors condemned by his predecessors, emphasizing
            the necessity of restoring the temporal power of the pope, and
            confirming and renewing all the protests of his predecessor Pius
            IX., of sacred memory, against the overthrow of the Papal States.
            On the first anniversary of his elevation he proclaimed a
            universal jubilee, with the promise of a complete indulgence. He
            still persisted in the prison myth of his predecessor, and like
            him sent back the profferred contribution of his <span class=

            inherited from Pius, as well as in his own, he has employed
            generally moderate and conciliatory language.—He has not
            hesitated to take the first step toward a good understanding with
            his opponents, for which, while persistently maintaining the
            ancient principles of the papal chair, he makes certain
            concessions in regard to subordinate matters, always with the
            design and expectation of seeing them outweighed on the other
            side by the conservation of all the other hierarchical
            pretensions of the curial system. It was, however, only in the
            middle of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            evident that the pope had determined, without allowing any
            misunderstanding to arise between himself and his cardinals, to
            break through the trammels of the irreconcilable zealots in the

            greater severity than Pius. Consequently the Roman Inquisition
            issued an instruction to all bishops throughout the Catholic
            world requiring them to enjoin their clergy in the pulpit and the
            confessional to make it known that all freemasons are <span lang=

            the third order of St. Francis (<a href="#Section_186_Para_2"
            class="tei tei-ref">§ 186, 2</a>), the injunction was carried
            out. At the same time a year's reprieve was given to the
            freemasons, during which the Roman heresy laws, which required
            their children, wives, and relatives to denounce them to all
            clergy and laymen, were to be suspended. Should the guilty,
            however, allow this day of grace to pass, these laws were to be
            again fully enforced, and then it would be only for the pope to
            absolve them from their terrible sin.</p>

            religious orders rapidly recovered lost ground. France decreed,
            on November 2nd, 1789, the abolition of all orders, and cloisters
            and in 1802, under Napoleon's auspices, they were also suppressed
            in the German empire and the friendly princes indemnified with
            their goods. Yet on grounds of utility Napoleon restored the
            Lazarists, as well as the Sisters of Mercy, whose scattered
            remnants he collected in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1807 in Paris into
            a general chapter, under the presidency of the empress-mother.
            But new cloisters in great numbers were erected specially in
            Belgium and France (in opposition to the law of 1789, which was
            unrepealed), in Austria, Bavaria, Prussia, Rhenish Hesse, etc.,
            as also in England and America. In 1849 there were in Prussia
            fifty monastic institutes; in 1872 there were 967. In Cologne one
            in every 215, in Aachen one in every 110, in Münster one in every
            sixty-one, in Paderborn one in every thirty-three, was a Catholic
            priest or member of an order. In Bavaria, between 1831 and 1873
            the number of cloisters rose from 43 to 628, all, with the
            exception of some old Benedictine monasteries, inspired and
            dominated by the Jesuits. Even the Dominicans, originally such
            determined opponents, are now pervaded by the Jesuit spirit. The

            through Europe and America, till after Napoleon's defeat they
            purchased back the monastery of La Trappe, and made it the centre
            of a group of new settlements throughout France and beyond

            were formed for the purposes of prayer, charity, education, and

            Provinces and Westphalia.—In Spain and Portugal (§ 205, <a href=

            the name of the Pius Verein was started at Mainz in October,
            1848, to further Catholic interests, advocating the church's
            independence of the State, the right of the clergy to direct
            education, etc. At the annual meetings its leading members
            boasted in grossly exaggerated terms of what had been
            accomplished and recklessly prophesied of what would yet be
            achieved. At the twenty-eighth general assembly at Bonn in

            attendance of 1,100, the same confident tone was maintained.
            Windhorst reminded the Prussian government of the purchase of the
            Sibylline books, and declared that each case of breaking off
            negotiations raised the price of the peace. Not a tittle of the
            ultramontane claims would be surrendered. The watchword is the

            speech with the summons to raise the membership of the union from
            80,000 to 800,000, yea to 8,000,000; then would the time be near
            when Germany should become again a Catholic land and the church
            again the leader of the people. At the assembly at Düsseldorf in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1883, Windhorst
            declared, amid the enthusiastic applause of all present, that
            after the absolute abrogation of the May laws the centre would
            not rest till education was again committed unreservedly to the
            church. In the assembly at Münster in <span class=

            the pope (notwithstanding all confiscation and imprisoning for
            the time being) as the governor and lord of the whole world. The
            thirty-third assembly at Breslau in <span class=

            Paderborn, aided needy Catholic congregations in Protestant
            districts. Other unions were devoted to foreign missions, to work
            among Germans in foreign lands, etc. In all the universities such
            societies were formed. In Bavaria patriot peasant associations
            were set on foot, as a standing army in the conflict of the
            ultramontane hierarchy with the new German empire. For the same

            various proposals for turning it to account in the interests of
            Catholicism. The Catholic Bank schemes of the Belgian
            Langrand-Dumonceau in 1872 and the Munich bank were pure
            swindles; and that of Adele Spitzeder 1869-1872, pronounced
            <span class="tei tei-q">“holy”</span> by the clergy and
            ultramontane press, collapsed with a deficit of eight and a
            quarter million florins.—Archbishop Purcell of Cincinnati invited
            church members to avoid risk to bank with him. He invested in
            land, advanced money for building churches, cloisters, schools,
            etc., and in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            bankrupt with liabilities amounting to five million dollars. He
            then offered to resign his office, but the pope refused and gave
            him a coadjutor, whereupon the archbishop retired into a cloister
            where he died in his eighty-third year. In the <span lang="fr"

            impulse given to Catholic interests after 1848 was seen in the
            zeal with which missions in Catholic lands, like the Protestant
            Methodist revival and camp-meetings (<a href=
            "#Section_208_Para_1" class="tei tei-ref">§ 208, 1</a>), began to
            be prosecuted. An attempt was thus made to gather in the masses,
            who had been estranged from the church during the storms of the
            revolution. The Jesuits and Redemptorists were prominent in this
            work. In bands of six they visited stations, staying for three
            weeks, hearing confessions, addressing meetings three times a

            for the spread of the faith, instituted in 1822, has a revenue of
            from four to six million francs. Specially famous is the
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Picpus
            Society</span></em>, so called from the street in Paris where it
            has its headquarters. Its founder was the deacon Coudrin, a pupil
            of the seminary for priests at Poictiers broken up in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1789. Amid the
            evils done to the church and the priests by the Revolution, in
            his hiding-place he heard a divine call to found a society for
            the purpose of training the youth in Catholic principles,
            educating priests, and bringing the gospel to the heathen
            <span class="tei tei-q">“by atoning for excesses, crimes, and
            sins of all kinds by an unceasing day and night devotion of the
            most holy sacrament of the altar.”</span> Such a society he
            actually founded in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1805, and Pius VII.
            confirmed it in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1817. The founder
            died in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1837, after his
            society had spread over all the five continents. Its chief aim
            henceforth was missions to the heathen. While the Picpus society,
            as well as the other seminaries and monkish orders, sent forth
            crowds of missionaries, other societies devoted themselves to
            collecting money and engaging in prayer. The most important of
            these is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Lyonese Society</span></em> for the spread
            of the faith of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1822. The member's
            weekly contribution is 5 cents, the daily prayer-demand a
            paternoster, an angel greeting, and a <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“St. Francis Xavier, pray for us.”</span> The
            fanatical journal of the society had a yearly circulation of
            almost 250,000 copies, in ten European languages. The popes had
            showered upon its members rich indulgences.—After Protestant
            missions had received such a powerful impulse in the nineteenth
            century, the Catholic societies were thereby impelled to force in
            wherever success had been won and seemed likely to be secured,
            and wrought with all conceivable jesuitical arts and devices, for
            the most part under the political protection of France. The
            Catholic missions have been most zealously and successfully
            prosecuted in North America, China, India, Japan, and among the
            schismatic churches of the Levant. Since 1837 they have been
            advanced by aid of the French navy in the South Seas (<a href=
            "#Section_184_Para_7" class="tei tei-ref">§ 184, 7</a>) and in
            North Africa by the French occupation of Algiers, and most
            recently in Madagascar. In South Africa they have made no
            progress.—In <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1837-1839 a bloody
            persecution raged in Tonquin and Cochin China; in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1866 Christianity
            was rooted out of Corea, and over 2,000 Christians slain; two
            years later persecution was renewed in Japan. In China, through
            the oppressions of the French, the people rose against the
            Catholics resident there. This movement reached a climax in the
            rebellion of 1870 at Tientsin, when all French officials,
            missionaries, and sisters of mercy were put to death, and the
            French consulate, Catholic churches and mission houses were
            levelled <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page236">[pg

            missions have again suffered, and many missionaries have been

            twenty years his mild and conciliatory as well as profoundly
            pious mysticism powerfully influenced crowds of students from

            intractable, youthful nature Sailer exercised a magic influence.

            ordained priest, became Sailer's secretary, remaining his
            confidential companion till his death, was made vicar-general to
            Sailer's successor in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            the archiepiscopal chair of Breslau, where he joined the
            ultramontanes, and entered with all his heart into the
            ecclesiastico-political conflicts of the Würzburg episcopal
            congress (<a href="#Section_192_Para_4" class="tei tei-ref">§

            letters, however, as well as his sermons and private
            correspondence, show that he never altogether forgot the teaching
            of his spiritual father. He delighted in the study of the
            mediæval mystics, and was specially drawn to the writings of
            Suso.</p>

            that of Sailer, having the doctrine of justification by faith
            alone as its centre, was originated by a simple Bavarian priest,
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Martin
            Boos</span></em>, and soon embraced sixty priests in the diocese
            of Augsburg. The spiritual experiences of Boos were similar to
            those of Luther. The words of a poor old sick woman brought peace
            to his soul in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1790, and led him
            to the study of Scripture. His preaching among the people and his
            conversations with the surrounding clergy produced a widespread
            revival. Amid manifold persecutions, removed from one parish to
            another, and flying from Bavaria to Austria and thence into
            Rhenish Prussia, where he died in <span class=

            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1825 as priest of
            Sayn, he lighted wherever he went the torch of truth. Even after
            his conversion Boos believed that he still maintained the
            Catholic position, but was at last to his own astonishment
            convinced of the contrary through intercourse with Protestant
            pietists and the study of Luther's works. But so long as the
            mother church would keep him he wished not to forsake her.<a id=

            St. Petersburg. Lindl, as Provost of South Russia, went to reside
            in Odessa, where he exercised a powerful influence over Catholics
            and Protestants and among the higher classes of the Russians. The
            machinations of the Roman Catholic and Greek churches caused both
            Gossner and Lindl to leave Russia in <span class=

            joined the evangelical church, Lindl in Barmen and Gossner in
            Berlin. Lindl drifted more and more into mystico-apocalyptic
            fanaticism; but Gossner, from <span class=

            the Bohemian church in Berlin, proved a sincere evangelical and a
            most successful worker.—The Bavarian priest Lutz of Carlshuld,
            influenced by Boos, devoted himself to the temporal and spiritual
            well-being of his people, preached Christ as the saviour of
            sinners, and exhorted to diligent reading of the Bible. In

            separation from his beloved people, he returned again after ten
            months, and most of his flock with him, still retaining his
            evangelical convictions. He was not, however, restored to office,

            deliverance from clerical tyranny, and founded in <span class=

            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">national Italian
            church</span></em> independent of the Romish curia. Four
            Neapolitan churches were put at the disposal of the society by
            the minister Ricasoli, but in 1865, an agreement having been come
            to between the curia and the government, the bishops were
            recalled and the churches restored. Thousands, to save themselves
            from starvation, gave in their submission, but a small party
            still remained faithful. Encouraged by the events of 1870 (§§
            135, 3; <a href="#Section_189_Para_3" class="tei tei-ref">189,
            3</a>), they were able in 1875 to draw up a <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“dogmatic statement”</span> for the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Church of Italy independent of the Roman
            hierarchy,”</span> which indeed besides the Holy Scriptures
            admitted the authority of the universal church as infallible
            custodian and interpreter of revealed truth, but accepted only
            the first seven œcumenical councils as binding. In the same year
            Bishop Turano of Girgenti excommunicated five priests of the
            Silician town Grotta as opponents of the syllabus and the dogma
            of infallibility. The whole clergy of the town, numbering
            twenty-five, then renounced their obedience to the bishop, and
            with the approval of the inhabitants declared themselves in
            favour of the <span class="tei tei-q">“statement.”</span> North
            of Rome this movement made little progress; but in 1875 three
            villages of the Mantuan diocese claimed the ancient privilege of
            choosing their own priest, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            obliged to yield. The Neapolitan movement, however, as a whole
            seems to be losing itself in the sand.</p>

            Archbishop Darboy when he inveighed against the corruptions of
            the church, and even Pius IX. on his visit to Rome in 1868
            treated him with favour. The general of his order having imposed
            silence on him, he publicly announced his secession from the
            order and appeared as a <span class="tei tei-q">“preacher of the
            gospel,”</span> claiming from a future General Council a sweeping
            reform of the church, protesting against the falsifying of the
            gospel of the Son of God by the Jesuits and the papal syllabus.
            He was then excommunicated. In <span class=

            by his marriage, this did not prevent the Old Catholics of Geneva
            from choosing him as their pastor. But after ten months, because
            <span class="tei tei-q">“he sought not the overthrow but the

            returned to Paris, where he endeavoured to establish a French
            National Church free of Rome and the Pope. The clerical minister
            Broglie, however, compelled him to restrict himself to
            moral-religious lectures. In February, 1879, he built a chapel in
            which he preaches on Sundays and celebrates mass in the French
            language. He sought alliance with the Swiss Christian Catholics,
            whose bishop, Herzog, heartily reciprocated his wishes, and with
            the Anglican church, which gave a friendly response. But that

            supported by Bonald, Chateaubriand, Lamartine, Lamennais,
            Lacordaire, and Montalembert. Only Bonald maintained this
            attitude. Between him and Chateaubriand a dispute arose over the
            freedom of the press; Lamennais and Lacordaire began to blend
            political radicalism with their ultramontanism; Lamartine
            involved himself in the February revolution of 1848 as the

            these marks were found to have been fraudulently made, but in
            other cases it was questionable whether we had not here a
            pathological problem, or whether hysteria created a desire to
            deceive or pre-disposed the subject to being duped under clerical
            influence. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Anna Cath. Emmerich</span></em>, a nun of
            Dülmen in Westphalia, in 1812, professed to have on her body
            bloody wound-marks of the Saviour. For five years down to her
            death in 1824, the poet Brentano sat at her feet, venerating her
            as a saint and listening to her ecstatic revelations on the death
            and sufferings of the Redeemer and his mother. Overberg, Sailer,
            and Von Stolberg were also satisfied of the genuineness of her
            revelations and of the miraculous marking of her body. The
            physician Von Drussel examined the wound-prints and certified
            them as miraculous; but Bodde, professor of chemistry at Münster,
            pronounced the blood marks spots produced by dragon's-blood.
            Competent physicians declared her a hysterical woman incapable of
            distinguishing between dream and reality, truth and lies, honesty
            and deceit. Others famous in the same line were Maria von Wörl,
            Dominica Lazzari, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            "font-style: italic">Louise Lateau</span></em>, daughter of a
            Belgian miner. On 24th April, 1868, it is said she was marked
            with the print of the Saviour's wounds on hands, feet, side,
            brow, and shoulders. In July, <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1868, she fell into
            an ecstasy, from which she could be awakened only by her bishop
            or one authorized by him. Trustworthy physicians, after a careful
            medical examination, reported that she laboured under a disease
            which they proposed to call <span class="tei tei-q">“stigmatic
            neuropathy.”</span> Chemical analysis proved the presence of food
            which had been regularly taken, probably in a somnambulistic
            trance. In the summer of 1875 her sister for a time put an end to
            the affair by refusing the clergy entrance into the house, and
            she was then obliged to eat, drink, and sleep like other
            Christians, so that the Friday bloody marks disappeared. But now,
            say ultramontane journals, Louise became dangerously ill, and
            clergy were called in to her help, and the marks were again
            visible. Her patron Bishop Dumont of Tournay being deposed by the
            pope in 1879, she took part against his successor, and was
            threatened with excommunication (<a href="#Section_200_Para_7"
            class="tei tei-ref">§ 200, 7</a>). She was now deserted by the
            ultramontanes and Belgian clergy, and treated as a poor,
            weak-minded invalid. She died neglected and in obscurity in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            no lack even in the most recent times. In 1845 <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Caroline
            Beller</span></em>, a girl of fifteen years, in Westphalia, was
            examined by a skilful physician. On Thursday he laid a linen
            cloth over the wound-prints, and sure enough on Friday it was
            marked with blood stains; but also strips of paper laid under,
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page244">[pg 244]</span><a name=

            knowledge, were pricked with needles. The delinquent now
            confessed her deceit, which she had been tempted to perpetrate
            from reading the works of Francis of Assisi, Catherine of Siena,
            and Emmerich. Theresa Städele in 1849, Rosa Tamisier in 1851, and
            Angela Hupe in 1863, were convicted of fraudulently pretending to
            have stigmata. The latter was proved to have feigned deafness and
            lameness for a whole year, to have diligently read the writings
            of Emmerich in 1861, to have shown the physician fresh bleeding
            wounds on hands, feet, and side, and to have affirmed that she
            had neither eaten nor drunk for a year. Four sisters of mercy
            were sent to attend her, and they soon discovered the fraud. In
            1876 the father confessor of Ernestine Hauser was prosecuted for
            damages, having injured the girl's health by the severe treatment
            to which she was subjected in order to induce ecstasy and obtain
            an opportunity for impressing the stigmata. <em class=

            years borne the reputation of a wonder-working saint, who every
            Friday showed the five wound prints, and in ecstasy told who were
            in hell and who in purgatory. She professed to live without food,
            though often she betook herself to the kitchen to pray alone, and
            even carried food with her to give to her guardian angel to carry
            to the distant poor. When under surveillance in 1880 she sought
            to bribe her guardian to bring her meat and drink, fragments of
            food were found among her clothes, and also a flask with blood
            and an instrument for puncturing the skin. She confessed her
            guilt, and was sentenced by the criminal court of Baden to ten
            weeks' imprisonment. The ultramontane <em class=

            the erection of a chapel on that spot. A miracle-working well

            the cures in number and significance far excelling anything heard

            lo, from the spot where her foot rested sprang up a well, at
            which innumerable cures have been wrought. The epidemic of
            visions of the Virgin reached a climax in Alsace Lorraine in

            craze spread over the whole land, and at thirty-five stations
            almost daily visions were enjoyed. The epidemic reached its
            crisis in Mary's month, May, 1874, and continued with intervals
            down to the end of the year. In some cases deceit was proved; but

            immaculate Virgin, and called for the erection of a chapel. A
            voice from heaven said, This is my beloved Son, etc. There were
            also processions and choirs of angels, etc. The devil, too,
            appeared and ordered them to fall down and worship him. Thousands

            had made roasted birds fly away off the spit, the Roman wits
            remarked that they would prefer a saint who would put birds on
            the spit for them. St. Liguori was canonized by Gregory XVI. in
            1839. Pius IX. canonized fifty-two and beatified twenty-six of
            the martyrs of Japan. The Franciscans had sought from Urban VIII.
            in 1627 canonization for six missionaries and seventeen Japanese
            converts martyred in 1596 (§ 150, 2), but were refused because
            they would not pay 52,000 Roman thalers for the privilege. Pius
            IX. granted this, and included three Jesuit missionaries. At
            Pentecost, 1862, the celebration took place, amid acclamations,
            firing of cannons, and ringing of bells. In 1868 the infamous
            president of the heretic tribunal Arbúes (§ 117, 2) received the

            unteachable, made a pilgrimage to Rome, where he stayed fifteen

            of St. Iago de Compostella (§ 88, 4) made excavations in the
            crypt of his cathedral, in consequence of an old tradition that
            the bones of the Apostle James the Elder, the supposed founder of
            the church, had been deposited there, and he succeeded in
            discovering a stone coffin with remains of a skeleton. The report
            of this made to Pius IX. gave occasion to the appointment of a
            commission of seven cardinals, who, after years of minute
            examination of all confirmatory historical, archæological,
            anatomical, and local questions, submitted their report to Leo
            XIII., whereupon, in November, 1884, he issued an <span class=

            four to six persons bound together by pocket-handkerchiefs held
            in their hands; Wilibrord's dance is played, and all jump in time
            to the music, five steps forward and two backward, or two
            backward and three forward, varied by three or four leaps to the
            right and then as many to the left. Thus continually leaping the
            procession goes through the streets of the city to the parish
            church, up the sixty-two steps of the church stair and along the
            church aisles to the tomb of Wilibrord (§ 78, 3). The dance is
            kept up incessantly for two hours. The performers do so generally
            because of a vow, or as penance for some fault, or to secure the
            saint's intercession for the cure of epilepsy and convulsive
            fits, common in that region, mainly no doubt owing to such
            senseless proceedings. The origin of the custom is obscure.
            Tradition relates that soon after the death of Wilibrord a
            disease appeared among the cattle which jumped incessantly in the
            stalls, till the people went leaping in procession to Wilibrord's
            tomb, and the plague was stayed! But the custom is probably a
            Christian adaptation of an old spring festival dance of pagan
            times (§ 75, 3; comp. 2 Sam. vi. 14).</p>

            immaculate conception, December 8th, 1869, all conceivable
            devices of skilful diplomacy were used by the Jesuit Camarilla,
            and friendly cajoling and violent threatening on the part of the
            pope, in order to silence or win over, and, in case this could
            not be done, to stifle and suppress the opposition which even
            already was not inconsiderable in point of numbers, but far more
            important in point of moral, theological, and hierarchical
            influence. The result aimed at was secured. Of the 150 original
            opponents only fifty dared maintain their opposition to the end,
            and even they cowardly shrank from a decisive conflict, and wrote

            "font-style: italic">Preliminary History of the
            Council.</span></em>—When Pius IX. on the centenary of St. Peter
            made known to the assembled bishops his intention to summon a
            general council, they expressed their conviction that by the
            blessing of the immaculate Virgin it would be a powerful means of
            securing unity, peace, and holiness. The formal summons was
            issued on the day of St. Peter and St. Paul of the following
            year, June 29th, 1868. The end for which the council was convened
            was stated generally as follows: The saving of the church and
            civil society from all evils threatening them, the thwarting of
            the endeavours of all who seek the overthrow of church and state,
            the uprooting of all modern errors and the downfall of all
            godless enemies of the apostolical chair. In Germany the Catholic
            General Assembly which met at Bamberg soon after this declared
            that from this day a new epoch in the world's history would
            begin, for <span class="tei tei-q">“either the salvation of the
            world would result from this council, or the world is beyond the
            reach of help.”</span> This hopefulness prevailed throughout the
            whole Catholic world. Fostered by the utterances of the
            <span lang="it" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "it"><span style="font-style: italic">Civiltà
            Cattolica</span></span>, the excitement grew from day to day. The
            learned bishop <span lang="it" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=

            Maret, dean of the theological faculty of Paris, now came forward
            as an eloquent exponent of the Gallican liberties; even the
            hitherto so strict Catholic, the Count Montalembert, to the
            astonishment of everybody, assumed a bold and independent
            attitude in regard to the council, and energetically protested in
            a publication of March 7th, 1870, six days before his death,
            against the intrigues of the Jesuits and the infallibility dogma
            which it was proposed to authorize. But the greatest excitement
            was occasioned by the work <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang=
            "de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Der Papst und das

            the pseudonym <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Janus</span></em>, of which the real authors
            were Döllinger, Friedrich, and Huber of Munich, who brought up
            the heavy artillery of the most comprehensive historical
            scholarship against the evident intentions of the curia. The
            German bishops gathered at the tomb of St. Boniface at Fulda in
            September, 1869, and issued from thence a general pastoral letter
            to their disturbed flocks, declaring that it was impossible that
            the council should decide otherwise than in accordance with holy
            Scripture and the apostolic traditions and what was already
            written upon the hearts of all believing Catholics. Also the
            papal secretary, Card. Antonelli, quieted the anxiety of the
            ambassadors of foreign powers at Rome by the assurance that the
            Holy See had in view neither the confirming of the syllabus nor
            the affirming of the dogma of infallibility. In vain did the
            Bavarian premier, Prince Hohenlohe, insist that the heads of
            other governments should combine in taking measures to prevent
            any <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page251">[pg 251]</span><a name=
            "Pg251" id="Pg251" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> encroachment of
            the council upon the rights of the state. The great powers
            resolved to maintain simply a watchful attitude, and only too
            late addressed earnest expostulations and threats.</p>

            Council.</span></em>—Of 1,044 prelates entitled to take part in
            the council 767 made their appearance, of whom 276 were Italians
            and 119 bishops <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=

            all pliable satellites of the curia, as were also the greater
            number of the missionary bishops, who, with their assistants in
            the propaganda, were supported at the cost of the holy father.
            The sixty-two bishops of the Papal States were doubly subject to
            the pope, and of the eighty Spanish and South American bishops it
            was affirmed in Rome that they would be ready at the bidding of
            the holy father to define the Trinity as consisting of four
            persons. Forty Italian cardinals and thirty generals of orders
            were equally dependable. The Romance races were represented by no
            less than 600, the German by no more than fourteen. For the first
            time since general councils were held was the laity entirely
            excluded from all influence in the proceedings, even the
            ambassadors of Catholic and tolerant powers. The order of
            business drawn up by the pope was arranged in all its details so
            as to cripple the opposition. The right of all fathers of the
            council to make proposals was indeed conceded, but a committee
            chosen by the pope decided as to their admissibility. From the
            special commissions, whose presidents were nominated by the pope,
            the drafts of decrees were issued to the general congregation,
            where the president could at will interrupt any speaker and
            require him to retract. Instead of the unanimity required by the
            canon law in matters of faith, a simple majority of votes was
            declared sufficient. A formal protest of the minority against
            these and similar unconstitutional proposals was left quite
            unheeded. The proceedings were indeed taken down by shorthand
            reporters, but not even members of council were allowed to see
            these reports. The conclusions of the general congregation were
            sent back for final revision to the special commissions, and when
            at last brought up again in the public sessions, they were not
            discussed, but simply voted on with a <span lang="la" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">placet</span></span> or a <span lang="la"
            class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">non-placet</span></span>. The right transept
            of St. Peter's was the meeting place of the council, the
            acoustics of which were as bad as possible, but the pope refused
            every request for more suitable accommodation. Besides, the
            various members spoke with diverse accents, and many had but a
            defective knowledge of Latin. Although absolute secresy was
            enjoined on pain of falling into mortal sin, under the excitement
            of the day so much trickled out and was in certain Romish circles
            so carefully gathered and sifted, that a tolerably complete
            insight was reached into the inner movements of the council. From
            such sources the author of the <span class=

            State, reached Munich, and there, after careful revision by

            the Pseudo-Isidore (§ 87, 2) and the assumptions of Gregory VII.,
            Innocent III. and Boniface VIII., reproduced in the principal
            propositions of the syllabus (<a href="#Section_184_Para_2"

            catechism to be enforced as a manual for the instruction of youth
            throughout the church. On March 6th there was added by way of
            supplement to the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"

            article in the form of a sketch of the decree of infallibility.
            Soon after the opening of the council an agitation in this
            direction had been started. An address to the pope emanating from
            the Jesuit college petitioning for this was speedily signed by
            400 subscribers. A counter address with 137 signatures besought
            the pope not to make any such proposal. At the head of the
            agitation in favour of infallibility stood archbishops Manning of
            Westminster, Deschamps of Mechlin, Spalding of Baltimore, and
            bishops Fessler of St. Pölten, secretary of the council,
            Senestrey of Regensburg, the <span class="tei tei-q">“overthrower

            prominent were cardinals Rauscher of Vienna, Prince Schwarzenberg
            of Prague and Matthieu of Besançon, Prince-bishop Förster of
            Breslau, archbishops Scherr of Munich, Melchers of Cologne,
            Darboy of Paris, and Kenrick of St. Louis, the bishops Ketteler
            of Mainz, Dinkel of Augsburg, Hefele of Rottenburg, Strossmayer
            of Sirmium, Dupanloup of Orleans, etc.—Owing to the discussions
            on the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Schema of the Faith</span></em> there
            occurred on March 22nd a stormy scene, which in its wild uproar
            reminds one of the disgraceful <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Robber Synod of
            Ephesus</span></em> (§ 52, 4). When Bishop Strossmayer objected
            to the statement made in the preamble, that the indifferentism,
            pantheism, atheism, and materialism prevailing in these days are
            chargeable upon Protestantism, as contrary to truth, the furious
            fathers of the majority amid shouts and roars, shaking of their
            fists, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page253">[pg

            rushed upon the platform, and the president was obliged to
            adjourn the sitting. At the next session the objectionable
            statement was withdrawn and the entire <span lang="la" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">schema</span></span> of the faith was
            unanimously adopted at the third public sitting of the council on
            April 24th. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">The Schema of the Church</span></em> came up
            for a consideration on May 10th. The discussion turned first and
            mainly on the fourth article about the infallibility of the pope.
            Its biblical foundation was sought in Luke xxii. 32, its
            traditional basis chiefly in the well-known passage of Irenæus (§
            34, 8) and on its supposed endorsement by the general councils of
            Lyons and Florence (§ 67, 4, 6), but the main stress was laid on
            its necessarily following from the position of the pope as the
            representative of Christ. The opposition party had from the
            outset their position weakened by the conduct of many of their
            adherents who, partly to avoid giving excessive annoyance to the
            pope, and partly to leave a door open for their retreat, did not
            contest the correctness of the doctrine in question, but all the
            more decidedly urged the inopportuneness of its formal definition
            as threatening the church with a schism and provocative of
            dangerous conflicts with the civil power. The longer the decision
            was deferred by passionate debates, the more determinedly did the
            pope throw the whole weight of his influence into the scales. By
            bewitching kindliness he won some, by sharp, angry words he
            terrified others. He denounced opponents as sectarian enemies of
            the church and the apostolic chair, and styled them ignoramuses,
            slaves of princes, and cowards. He trusted the aid of the blessed
            Virgin to ward off threatened division. To the question whether
            he himself regarded the formulating of the dogma as opportune, he
            answered: <span class="tei tei-q">“No, but as necessary.”</span>
            Urged by the Jesuits, he confidently declared that it was
            notorious that the whole church at all times taught the absolute
            infallibility of the pope; and on another occasion he silenced a
            modest doubt as to a sure tradition with the dictatorial words,
            <span lang="it" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=

            I have experienced it.”</span> On July 13th the final vote was
            called for in the general congregation. There were 371 who voted
            simply <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=

            hopeless attempt by a deputation to obtain the pope's consent to
            a milder formulating of the decree, Bishop Ketteler vainly
            entreating on his knees, to save the unity and peace of the
            church by some small concession, the fifty hitherto steadfast
            members of the minority returned home, after emitting a written
            declaration that they after as well as before must continue to
            adhere to their negative vote, but from reverence and respect for
            the person of the pope they declined to give effect to it at a
            public session. On the following day, July 18th, the fourth and

            predecessors and successors.—It was on the evening preceding the
            proclamation of this new dogma that Napoleon III. proclaimed war
            with Prussia, in consequence of which the pope lost the last
            remnants of temporal sovereignty and every chance of its
            restoration. Under the influence of the fever-fraught July sun,
            the council now dwindled down to 150 members, and, after the
            whole glory of the papal kingdom had gone down (<a href=

            October 20th, its sittings were suspended until better times. The

            "font-style: italic">Acceptance of the Decrees of the
            Council.</span></em>—All protests which during the council the
            minority had made against the order of business determined on and
            against all irregularities resulting from it, because not
            persisted in, were regarded as invalid. Equally devoid of legal
            force was their final written protest which they left behind, in
            which they expressly declined to exercise their right of voting.
            And the assent which they ultimately without exception gave to
            the objective standpoint of the law and the faith of the Catholic
            church, was not in the least necessary in order to make it appear
            that the decisions of the council, drawn up with such unanimity
            as had scarcely ever before been seen, were equally valid with
            any of the decrees of the older councils. Thus the bishops of the
            minority, if they did not wish to occasion a split of unexampled
            dimensions and incalculable complications, quarrels, and
            contentions in the church that boasted of a unity which had
            hitherto been its strength and stay, could do nothing else than
            yield at the twelfth hour to the pope's demand that <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“<span lang="it" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "it"><span style="font-style: italic">sacrificio
            dell'intelletto</span></span>”</span> which at the eleventh hour
            they had refused. The German bishops, who had proved most
            steadfast at the council, were now in the greatest haste to make
            their submission. Even by the end of August, at Fulda, they
            joined their infallibilist neighbours in addressing a pastoral
            letter, in which they most solemnly declared that all true
            Catholics, as they valued their soul's salvation, must
            unconditionally accept the conclusions of the council unanimously
            arrived at which are in no way prejudiced by the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“differences of opinion”</span> elicited during the
            discussion. At the same time they demanded of theological
            professors, teachers of religion, and clergymen throughout the
            dioceses a formal acceptance of these decrees as the inviolable
            standpoint of their <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page255">[pg
            255]</span><a name="Pg255" id="Pg255" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            doctrinal teaching; they also took measures against those who
            refused to yield, and excommunicated them. Even Bishop Hefele,
            who did not sign this pastoral and was at first determined not to
            yield nor swerve, at last gave way. In his pastoral proclaiming
            the new dogma he gave it a quite inadmissible interpretation: As
            the infallibility of the church, so also that of the pope as a
            teacher, extends only to the revealed doctrines of faith and
            morals, and even with reference to them only the definitions
            proper and not the introductory statements, grounds, and
            applications, belong to the infallible department. But
            subsequently he cast himself unreservedly into the arms of his
            colleagues assembled once again at Fulda in September, 1872,
            where he also found his like-minded friend, Bishop Haneberg of
            Spires. Yet he forbore demanding an express assent from his
            former colleagues at Tübingen and his clergy, and thus saved
            Württemberg from a threatened schism. Strossmayer held out
            longest, but even he at last threw down his weapons. But many of
            the most cultured and scholarly of the theological professors,
            disgusted with the course events were taking, withdrew from the
            field and continued silently to hold their own opinions. The
            inferior clergy, for the most part trained by ultramontane
            bigots, and held in the iron grasp of strict hierarchical
            discipline, passed all bounds in their extravagant glorification
            of the new dogma. And while among the liberal circles of the
            Catholic laity it was laughed at and ridiculed, the bigoted
            nobles and the masses who had long been used to the incensed
            atmosphere of an enthusiastic adoration of the pope, bowed the
            knee in stupid devotion to the papal god. But the brave heart of
            one noble German lady broke with sorrow over the indignity done
            by the Vatican decree and the characterlessness of the German
            bishops to the church of which to her latest breath she remained
            in spirit a devoted member. Amalie von Lasaulx, sister of the
            Munich scholar Ernst von Lasaulx (<a href="#Section_174_Para_4"
            class="tei tei-ref">§ 174, 4</a>), from 1849 superioress of the
            Sisters of Mercy in St. John's Hospital at Bonn, lay beyond hope
            of recovery on a sick-bed to which she had been brought by her
            self-sacrificing and faithful discharge of the duties of her
            calling, when there came to her from the lady superior of the
            order at Nancy the peremptory demand to give in her adhesion to
            the infallibility dogma. As she persistently and courageously
            withstood all entreaties and threats, all adjurations and cruelly
            tormenting importunings, she was deposed from office and driven
            from the scene of her labours, and when, soon thereafter, in
            1872, she died, the habit of her order was stripped from her
            body. The Old Catholics of Bonn, whose proceedings she had not
            countenanced, charged themselves with securing for her a
            Christian burial.—No state as such has recognised the council.
            Austria answered it by abolishing the concordat and forbidding
            the proclamation of the decrees. Bavaria and Saxony <span class=

            Württemberg declared that the conclusions of the council had not
            binding authority in law. Prussia indeed held to its principle of
            not interfering in the internal affairs of the Catholic church,
            but, partly for itself, partly as the leading power of the new
            German empire, passed a series of laws in order to resume its too
            readily abandoned rights of sovereignty over the affairs of the
            Catholic church, and to insure itself against further
            encroachments of ultramontanism upon the domain of civil life
            (<a href="#Section_197" class="tei tei-ref">§ 197</a>). The
            Romance states, on the other hand, pre-eminently France, were
            prevented by internal troubles and conflicts from taking any very
            decisive steps.</p>

            promising reaction, mainly in Germany, led by men highly
            respected and eminent for their learning, set in against the
            Vatican Council and its decrees, in the so-called Old Catholic
            movement of the liberal circles of the Catholic people, which
            went the length, even in 1873, of establishing an independent and
            well organized episcopal church. Since then, indeed, it has
            fallen far short of the all too sanguine hopes and expectations
            at first entertained; but still within narrower limits it
            continues steadily to spread and to rear for itself a solid
            structure, while carefully, even nervously, shrinking from
            anything revolutionary. More in touch with the demands of the

            particular to the positive doctrines of orthodoxy, the Old

            other Catholic countries its success has been relatively

            Catholic Church in the German Empire.</span></em>—In the
            beginning of August, 1870, the hitherto exemplary Catholic
            professor Michelis of Braunsberg (<a href="#Section_191_Para_6"
            class="tei tei-ref">§ 191, 6</a>), issued a public charge against
            Pius IX. as a heretic and devourer of the church, and by the end
            of August several distinguished theologians (Döllinger and
            Friedrich of Munich, Reinkens, Weber, and Baltzer of Breslau,
            Knoodt of Bonn, and the canonist Von Schulte of Prague) joined
            him at Nuremberg in making a public declaration that the Vatican
            Council could not be regarded as œcumenical, nor its new dogma as
            a Catholic <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page257">[pg
            257]</span><a name="Pg257" id="Pg257" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            doctrine. This statement was subscribed to by forty-four Catholic
            professors of the university of Munich with the rector at their
            head, but without the theologians. Similarly, too, several
            Catholic teachers in Breslau, Freiburg, Würzburg, and Bonn
            protested, and still more energetically a gathering of Catholic
            laymen at Königswinter. Besides the Breslau professors already
            named, the Bonn professors Reusch, Langen, Hilgers, and Knoodt
            refused to subscribe the council decrees at the call of their
            bishop; whereas the Munich professors, with the exception of
            Döllinger and Friedrich, yielded. A repeated injunction of his
            archbishop in January, 1871, drew from Döllinger the statement
            that he as a Christian, a theologian, a historian, and a citizen,
            was obliged to reject the infallibility dogma, while at the same
            time he was prepared before an assembly of bishops and
            theologians to prove that it was opposed to Scripture, the
            Fathers, tradition, and history. He was now literally overwhelmed
            with complimentary addresses from Vienna, Würzburg, Munich, and
            almost all other cities of Bavaria; and an address to government
            on the dangers to the state threatened by the Vatican decrees
            that lay at the Munich Museum, was quickly filled with 12,000
            signatures. On April 14th, Döllinger was excommunicated, and
            Professor Huber sent an exceedingly sharp reply to the
            archbishop. After several preliminary meetings, the <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">first
            congress</span></em> of the Old Catholics was held in Munich in
            September, 1871, attended by 500 deputies from all parts of
            Germany. A programme was unanimously adopted which, with
            protestation of firm adherence to the faith, worship, and
            constitution of the ancient Catholic church, maintained the
            invalidity of the Vatican decrees and the excommunication
            occasioned by them, and, besides recognising the Old Catholic
            church of Utrecht (<a href="#Section_165_Para_8" class=
            "tei tei-ref">§ 165, 8</a>), expressed a hope of reunion with the
            Greek church, as well as of a gradual progress towards an
            understanding with the Protestant church. But when at the second
            session the president, Dr. von Schulte, proposed the setting up
            of independent public services with regular pastors, and the
            establishing as soon as possible of an episcopal government of
            their own, Döllinger contested the proposal as a forsaking of the
            safe path of lawful opposition, taking the baneful course of the
            Protestant Reformation, and tending toward the formation of a
            sect. As, however, the proposal was carried by an overwhelming
            majority, he declined to take further part in their public
            assemblies and retired more into the background, without
            otherwise opposing the prevailing current or detaching himself
            from it. The second congress was held at Cologne in the autumn of
            1872. From the episcopal churches of England and America, from
            the orthodox church of Russia, from France, Italy, and Spain,
            were sent deputies and hearty friendly greetings. Archbishop Loos
            of Utrecht, by the part which he took in the congress,
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page258">[pg 258]</span><a name=
            "Pg258" id="Pg258" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> cemented more
            closely the union with the Old Catholics of Holland. Even the
            German <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="de" class=

            "font-style: italic">Protestantenverein</span></span>”</span> was
            not unrepresented. A committee chosen for the purpose drew up an
            outline of a synodal and congregational order, which provides for
            the election of bishops at an annual meeting at Pentecost of a
            synod, of which all the clergy are members and to which the
            congregations send deputies, one for every 200 members. Alongside
            of the bishop stands a permanent synodal board of five priests
            and seven laymen. The bishop and synodal board have the right of
            vetoing doubtful decrees of synod. The choice of pastors lies
            with the congregation; its confirmation belongs to the bishop. In
            July, 1873, a bishop was elected in the Pantaleon church of
            Cologne by an assembly of delegates, embracing twenty-two priests
            and fifty-five laymen. The choice fell upon Professor Reinkens,
            who, as meanwhile Bishop Loos of Utrecht had died, was
            consecrated on August 11th, at Rotterdam, by Bishop Heykamp of
            Deventer, and selected Bonn as his episcopal residence.</p>

            Catholics, consisting of thirty clerical and fifty-nine lay
            members, met at Bonn in May, 1874. It was agreed to continue the
            practice of auricular confession, but without any pressure being
            put upon the conscience or its observance being insisted upon at
            set times. Similarly the moral value of fasting was recognised,
            but all compulsory abstinence, and all distinctions of food as
            allowable and unallowable, were abolished. The second synod, with
            reference to the marriage law, took the position that civil
            regular marriages ought also to have the blessing of the church;
            only in the case of marriages with non-Christians and divorced
            parties should this be refused. The third synod introduced a
            German ritual in which the exorcism was omitted, while the Latin
            mass was provisionally retained. The fourth synod allowed to such
            congregations as might wish it the use of the vernacular in
            several parts of the service of the mass. At all these synods the
            lay members had persistently repeated the proposal to abolish the
            obligatory celibacy of the clergy. But now the agitation,
            especially on the part of the Baden representatives, had become
            so keen, that at the fifth synod of 1878, in spite of the warning
            read by Bishop Reinkens from the Dutch Old Catholics, who
            threatened to withdraw from the communion, the proposal was
            carried by seventy-five votes against twenty-two. The Bonn
            professors, Langen and Menzel, foreseeing this result, had
            absented themselves from the synod, Reusch immediately withdrew
            and resigned his office as episcopal vicar-general, Friedrich
            protested in the name of the Bavarian Old Catholics. Reinkens,
            too, had vigorously opposed the movement; whereas Knoodt,
            Michelis, and Von Schulte had favoured it. The synod of 1883
            resolved to dispense the supper in both kinds to members of the
            Anglican church residing <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            follow meanwhile the usual practice of <span lang="la" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">communio sub una</span></span>. The number
            of Old Catholic congregations in the German empire is now 107,
            with 38,507 adherents and 56 priests.—Even at their first
            congress the German Old Catholics, in opposition to the
            unpatriotic and law-defying attitude of German ultramontanism,
            had insisted upon love of country and obedience to the laws of
            the state as an absolute Christian duty. Their newly chosen
            bishop Reinkens, too, gave expression to this sentiment in his
            first pastoral letter, and had the oath of allegiance
            administered him by the Prussian, Baden, and Hessian governments.
            But Bavaria felt obliged, on account of the terms of its
            concordat, to refuse. At first the Old Catholics had advanced the
            claim to be the only true representatives of the Catholic church
            as it had existed before July 18th, 1870. At the Cologne congress
            they let this assumption drop, and restricted their claims upon
            the state to equal recognition with <span class="tei tei-q">“the
            New Catholics,”</span> equal endowments for their bishop, and a
            fair proportion of the churches and their revenues. Prussia
            responded with a yearly episcopal grant of 16,000 thalers; Baden
            added about 6,000. It proved more difficult to enforce their
            claim to church property. A law was passed in Baden in 1874,
            which not only guaranteed to the Old Catholic clergy their
            present benefices and incomes, freed them from the jurisdiction
            of the Romish hierarchy, and gave them permission to found
            independent congregations, but also granted them a mutual right
            of possessing and using churches and church furniture as well as
            sharing in church property according to the numerical proportion
            of the two parties in the district. A similar measure was
            introduced into the Prussian parliament, and obtained the royal
            assent in July, 1875. Since then, however, the interest of the
            government in the Old Catholic movement has visibly cooled. In
            Baden, in 1886 the endowment had risen to 24,000 marks.</p>

            rather, as it has there been called, the Christian, Catholic
            movement, had its origin in 1871 in the diocese of
            Basel-Solothurn, whence it soon spread through the whole country.
            The national synod held at Olten in 1876 introduced the
            vernacular into the church services, abolished the compulsory
            celibacy of the clergy and obligatory confession of communicants,
            and elected Professor Herzog bishop, Reinkens giving him
            episcopal consecration. In 1879 the number of Christian Catholics
            in German Switzerland amounted to about 70,000, with seventy-two
            pastors. But since then, in consequence of the submission of the
            Roman Catholics to the church laws condemned by Pius IX. they
            have lost the majority in no fewer than thirty-nine out of the
            forty-three congregations of Canton Bern, and therewith the
            privileges attached. A proposal made in the grand council of the
            canton in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page260">[pg
            260]</span><a name="Pg260" id="Pg260" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            1883 for the suppression of the Christian Catholic theological
            faculty in the University of Bern, which has existed since 1874,
            was rejected by one hundred and fifty votes against
            thirteen.—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">In Austria</span></em>, too, strong
            opposition was shown to the infallibility dogma. At Vienna the
            first Old Catholic congregation was formed in February, 1872,
            under the priest Anton; and soon after others were established in
            Bohemia and Upper Austria. But it was not till October, 1877,
            that they obtained civil recognition on the ground that their
            doctrine is that which the Catholic church professed before 1870.
            In June, 1880, they held their first legally sanctioned synod.
            The provisional synodical and congregational order was now
            definitely adopted, and the use of the vernacular in the church
            services, the abolition of compulsory fasting, confession, and
            celibacy, as well as of surplice fees, and the abandoning of all
            but the high festivals, were announced on the following Sunday.
            The bitter hatred shown by the Czechs and the ultramontane clergy
            to everything German has given to the Old Catholic movement for
            some years past a new impulse and decided advantage.—<em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">In
            France</span></em> the Abbé Michaud of Paris lashed the
            characterlessness of the episcopate and was excommunicated, and
            the Abbés Mouls and Junqua of Bordeaux were ordered by the police
            to give up wearing the clerical dress. Junqua, refusing to obey
            this order, was accused by Cardinal Donnet, Bishop of Bordeaux,
            before the civil court, and was sentenced to six months'
            imprisonment. Not till 1879 did the ex-Carmelite Loyson of Paris
            lay the foundation of a Catholic Gallican church, affiliated with
            the Swiss Old Catholics (<a href="#Section_187_Para_8" class=
            "tei tei-ref">§ 187, 8</a>).—<em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">In
            Italy</span></em> since 1862, independently of the German
            movement, yet on essentially the same grounds, a national Italian
            church was started with very promising beginnings, which were
            not, however, realized (<a href="#Section_187_Para_7" class=
            "tei tei-ref">§ 187, 7</a>). Rare excitement was caused
            throughout Italy by the procedure of Count Campello, canon of St.
            Peter's in Rome, who in 1881 publicly proclaimed his creed in the
            Methodist Episcopal chapel, there renouncing the papacy, and in a
            published manifesto addressed to the cathedral chapter justified
            this step and made severe charges against the papal curia; but
            soon after, in a letter to Loyson, he declared that he, remaining
            faithful to the true Catholic church, did not contemplate joining
            any Protestant sect severed from Catholic unity, and in a
            communication to the Old Catholic Rieks of Heidelberg professed
            to be in all points at one with the German Old Catholics.
            Accordingly he sought to form in Rome a Catholic reform party,
            whose interests he advocated in the journal <span lang="it"

            chaplain, Monsignor Savarese, has adopted a similar attitude. In
            December, 1883, he was received by the pastor of the American
            Episcopal church at Rome into the Old Catholic church on
            subscribing the Nicene Creed. In 1886 they were joined by another

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Catholic
            theology in Germany, influenced by the scientific spirit
            prevailing in Protestantism, received a considerable impulse.
            From latitudinarian Josephinism it gradually rose toward a
            strictly ecclesiastical attitude. Most important were its
            contributions in the department of dogmatic and speculative
            theology. Besides and after the schools of Hermes, Baader, and
            Günther, condemned by the papal chair, appeared a whole series of
            speculative dogmatists who kept their speculations within the
            limits of the church confession. Also in the domain of church
            history, Catholic theology, after the epoch-making productions of
            Möhler and Döllinger, has aided in reaching important results,
            which, however, owing to the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“tendency”</span> character of their researches,
            demand careful sifting. Least important are their contributions
            to biblical criticism and exegesis. In general, however, the
            theological <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "la"><span style="font-style: italic">docents</span></span> at
            the German universities give a scientific character to their
            researches and lectures in respect of form and also of matter, so
            far as the Tridentine limits will allow. But the more the Jesuits
            obtained influence in Germany, the more was that scholasticism,
            which repudiated the German university theology and opposed it
            with perfidious suspicions and denunciations, naturalized,
            especially in the episcopal seminaries, while it was recommended
            by Rome as the official theology. The attempt, however, at the
            Munich Congress of Scholars in 1863 to come to an understanding
            between the two tendencies failed, owing to the contrariety of
            their principles and the opposition <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            theology, especially in the department of history, manifested a
            praiseworthy activity. In Spain theology has never outgrown the
            period of the Middle Ages. In Italy, on the other hand, the study
            of Christian antiquities flourished, stimulated by recent
            discoveries of treasures in catacombs, museums, archives, and
            libraries.</p>

            Trent, assured it would stand the test, through the fire of doubt
            and the scrutiny of reason, because only what survives such
            examination could be scientifically vindicated. He died in

            school named after him, mainly in Treves, Bonn, and Breslau.
            Gregory XVI. in 1835 condemned his writings, and the new
            Archbishop of Cologne, Droste-Vischering, forbad students at Bonn
            attending the lectures of Hermesians. These made every effort to
            secure the recall of the papal censure. Braun and Elvenich went
            to Rome, but their declaration that Hermes had not taught what
            the pope condemned profited them as little as a similar statement
            had the Jansenists. There now arose on both sides a bitter
            controversy, which received new fuel from the Prusso-Cologne
            ecclesiastical strife (<a href="#Section_193_Para_1" class=
            "tei tei-ref">§ 193, 1</a>). Finally in 1844 professors Braun and
            Achterfeld of Bonn were deprived of office by the
            coadjutor-Archbishop Geissel, and the Prussian government
            acquiesced. The professors of the Treves seminary and Baltzer of
            Breslau, the latter influenced by Günther's theology,
            retracted.—A year before Hermes' condemnation the same pope had
            condemned the opposite theory of Abbé <em class=

            Christian dogmas cannot be proved but only believed, and that
            therefore all use of reason in the appropriation of the truths of
            salvation is excluded. Bautain, as an obedient son of the church,

            theology for a long time paid no regard to the development of
            German philosophy. Only after Schelling, whose philosophy had
            many points of contact with the Catholic doctrine, a general
            interest in such studies was awakened as forming a speculative
            basis for Catholicism. To the theosophy of Schelling based on
            that of the Görlitz shoemaker (<a href="#Section_160_Para_2"

            the secular priest <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            profound and original thinker of combative humour, sprightly wit,
            and a roughness of expression sometimes verging upon the
            burlesque. He recognised the necessity of going up in
            philosophical and theological speculation to Descartes, who held
            by the scholastic dualism of God and the creature, the Absolute
            and the finite, spirit and nature, while all philosophy,
            according to him, had been ever plunging deeper into pantheistic
            monism. Thence he sought to solve the two problems of Christian
            speculation, creation and incarnation, and undertook a war of
            extermination against <span class="tei tei-q">“all monism and

            "font-style: italic">Pabst</span></em>, doctor of medicine in
            Vienna, who gave clear expositions of his master's dark and
            aphoristic sayings, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Veith</span></em>, who popularized his
            teachings in sermons and practical treatises. Some of the
            Hermesians, such as Baltzer of Breslau, entered the rank of his
            scholars. The historico-political papers, however, charged him
            with denying the mysteries of Christianity, rejecting the
            traditional theology, etc., and Clemens, a <span lang="de" class=

            Bonn, became the mouthpiece of this party. Thus arose a
            passionate controversy, which called forth the attention of Rome.
            We might have expected Günther to meet the fate of Hermes twenty
            years before; but the matter was kept long under consideration,
            for strong influence from Vienna was brought to bear on his
            behalf. At last in January, 1857, the formal reprobation of the
            Güntherian philosophy was announced, and all his works put in the
            Index. Günther humbly submitted to the sentence of the church. So
            too did <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Baltzer</span></em>. But being suspected at
            Rome, he was asked voluntarily to resign. This Baltzer refused to
            do. Then Prince-Bishop Förster called upon the government to
            deprive him; and when this failed, he withdrew from him the

            in 1870, on his opposing the infallibility dogma, he withheld the
            other two-thirds. His salary from the State continued to be paid
            in full till his death in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            Schleiermacher's works and those of other Protestants, and
            putting all his rich endowments at the service of the church, he
            won for himself among Catholics a position like that of
            Schleiermacher among Protestants. His first treatise of 1825, on
            the unity of the church, was followed by his <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Athanasius the Great,”</span> and the work of his
            life, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Symbolics”</span> of 1832, in
            its ninth edition in 1884, which with the apparatus of Protestant
            science combats the Protestant church doctrine and presented the
            Catholic doctrine in such an ennobled and sublimated form, that
            Rome at first seriously thought of placing it in the Index.
            Hitherto Protestants had utterly ignored the productions of
            Catholic theology, but to overlook a scientific masterpiece like
            this would be a confession of their own weakness. And in fact,
            during the whole course of the controversy between the two
            churches, no writing from the Catholic camp ever caused such
            commotion among the Protestants as this. The ablest Protestant
            replies are those of Nitsch and Baur. In 1835 Möhler left
            Tübingen for Munich; but sickness hindered his scientific
            labours, and, in 1838, in the full bloom of manhood, the Catholic
            church and Catholic science had to mourn his death. He can
            scarcely be said to have formed a school; but by writings,
            addresses, and conversation he produced a scientific ferment in
            the Catholic theology of Germany, which continued to work until
            at last completely displaced by the scholasticism reintroduced
            into favour by the Jesuits.</p>

            alongside of and after Möhler, by far the most famous on either
            side of the Alps was the church historian Döllinger, professor at
            Munich since 1826. His first important work issued in that same
            year was on the <span class="tei tei-q">“Doctrine of the
            Eucharist in the First Three Centuries.”</span> His comprehensive
            work, <span class="tei tei-q">“The History of the Christian
            Church,”</span> of 1833 (4 vols., London, 1840), was not carried
            beyond the second volume; and his <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Text-book of Church History”</span> of 1836, was
            only carried down to the Reformation. The tone of his writings
            was strictly ecclesiastical, yet without condoning the moral
            faults of the popes and hierarchy. Great excitement was produced
            by his treatise on <span class="tei tei-q">“The
            Reformation,”</span> in which he gathered everything that could
            be found unfavourable to the Reformers and their work, and thus
            gained the summit of renown as a miracle of erudition and a
            master of Catholic orthodoxy. Meanwhile in 1838 he had taken part
            in controversies about mixed marriages (<a href=
            "#Section_193_Para_1" class="tei tei-ref">§ 193, 1</a>), and in
            1843 over the genuflection question (<a href=
            "#Section_195_Para_2" class="tei tei-ref">§ 195, 2</a>), with
            severely hierarchical pamphlets. As delegate of the university
            since 1845 he defended with brilliant eloquence in the Bavarian
            chamber the measures of the ultramontane government and the
            hierarchy, became in 1847 Provost of St. Cajetan, but was also in
            the same year involved in the overthrow <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page265">[pg 265]</span><a name="Pg265" id="Pg265" class=

            his professorship. In the following year he was one of the most
            distinguished of the Catholic section in the Frankfort
            parliament, where he fought successfully in the hierarchical
            interest for the unconditional freedom and independence of the
            church. King Maximilian II. restored him to his professorship in
            1849. From this time his views of confessional matters became
            milder and more moderate. He first caused great offence to his
            ultramontane admirers at Easter, 1861, when he in a series of
            public lectures delivered one on the Papal States then
            threatened, in which he declared that the temporal power of the
            pope, the abuses of which he had witnessed during a journey to
            Rome in 1857, was by no means necessary for the Catholic church,
            but was rather hurtful. The papal nuncio, who was present,
            ostentatiously left the meeting, and the ultramontanes were
            beside themselves with astonishment, horror, and wrath. Döllinger
            gave some modifying explanations at the autumn assembly of the
            Catholic Union at Munich in 1861. But soon thereafter appeared
            his work, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Church and the
            Churches”</span> (London, 1862), which gave the lecture slightly
            modified as an appendix. The <span class="tei tei-q">“Fables
            respecting the Popes of the Middle Ages”</span> (London, 1871),
            was as little to the taste of the ultramontanes. Indeed in these
            writings, especially in the first named, the polemic against the
            Protestant Church had all its old bitterness; but he is at least
            more just toward Luther, whom he characterizes as <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“the most powerful man of the people, the most
            popular character, which Germany ever possessed.”</span> And
            while he delivers a glowing panegyric on the person of the pope,
            he lashes unrelentingly the misgovernment of the Papal States. At
            the Congress of Scholars at Munich he contended for the freedom
            of science. Döllinger as president of the congress sent the pope
            a telegram which satisfied his holiness. But the Jesuits looked
            deeper, and immediately <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="it"

            the life office of imperial councillor, he voted with the bishops

            battle against the council and infallibility made the rent
            incurable, and his angry archbishop hurled against him the great
            excommunication. Then Vienna made him doctor of philosophy,
            Marburg, Oxford, and Edinburgh gave him LL.D., and the senate of
            his university unanimously elected him rector in 1871. But his
            tabooed lecture room became more and more deserted. He took no

            works were placed in the Index, asked for a revision on the
            ground that he taught nothing contrary to Catholic doctrine. He
            was stripped of all his clerical functions, and students were
            prohibited attending his lectures. He protested, and his rooms
            were more crowded than ever. Subsequently, however, repudiated
            even by the Old Catholics, he drifted more and more, not only
            from the church, but even from belief in revelation. Against
            Strauss' last work he wrote a tract in which he sought to prove

            later studies and writings estranged him more and more from

            but his unbridled bibliomania while assistant in the Royal
            Library of St. Petersburg in 1871, brought his public career to a

            anti-Vaticanists aid from the library and sought to influence the
            pope against him so as to deprive him of his office of prefect of
            the Vatican archives. He was suspended from his duties, and
            though he still retained his title and occupied his official
            residence in the Vatican, the doors from it into the library were
            built up. His edition of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Acts of the
            Council of Trent,”</span> which was commenced, was also
            prohibited. But he succeeded in making a transcript at Agram in
            Croatia, where in 1874 a portion of it, the official protocol of
            the secretary of the Council, Massarelli, was printed by the help
            of Bishop Strossmayer in an elegant style but abbreviated, and
            therefore unsatisfactory. Cardinal Angelo <em class=

            theologians. After high mass, accompanied with the recitation of

            admitted as a religious duty that all scientific discussions and

            acquiesced in with a bad grace at the second and last congress at

            three out of its thirty members being Germans, Kleutgen, Stöckl,

            submitted himself <span class="tei tei-q">“humbly,”</span> being

            the history of the Christian church and state has been rendered
            by the same pope, undoubtedly at the instigation of Cardinal
            Hergenröther, by the access granted not only to Catholic but also
            to Protestant investigators to the exceedingly rich treasures of
            the Vatican archives. Though still hedged round with considerable
            limitations, the concession seems liberality itself as compared
            with the stubborn refusal of Pius IX. to facilitate the studies
            of any inquirer. With honest pride the pope could inscribe on his
            bust placed in the library: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang=

            in view and what the hopes that he cherished is seen from the
            rescript of August, 1883, in which he calls upon the cardinals De
            Luca, Pitra, and Hergenröther, as prefects of the committee of
            studies, of the library and archives, while proclaiming the great
            benefits which the papacy has secured to Italy, to do their
            utmost to overthrow <span class="tei tei-q">“the lies uttered by
            the sects”</span> on the history of the church, especially in

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Peace of
            Luneville of 1801 gave the deathblow to the old German empire, by
            the formal cession of the left bank of the Rhine to France,
            indemnifying the secular princes who were losers by this
            arrangement with estates and possessions on the right of the
            Rhine, taken from the neutral free cities of the empire and the
            secularized ecclesiastical principalities, institutions,
            monasteries, and orders. An imperial commission sitting at
            Regensburg arranged the details of these indemnifications. They
            were given expression to by means of the imperial commission's
            decree or recess of 1803. The dissolution of the constitution of
            the German empire thus effected was still further carried out by
            the Peace of Presburg of 1805, which conferred upon the
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page272">[pg 272]</span><a name=
            "Pg272" id="Pg272" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> princes of
            Bavaria, Württemberg, and Baden, in league with Napoleon, full
            sovereignty, and to the two first named the rank of kings, and
            was completed by the founding of the Confederation of the Rhine
            of 1806, in which sixteen German princes formally severed
            themselves from the emperor and empire and ranked themselves as
            vassals of France under the protectorate of Napoleon. Francis
            II., who already in 1804 had assumed the title of Emperor of
            Austria as Francis I., now that the German empire had actually
            ceased to exist, renounced also the name of German emperor. The
            unhappy proceedings of the Vienna Congress of the German
            Confederation and its permanent representation in the Frankfort
            parliament during 1814 and 1815, after Napoleon's twice repeated
            defeat, led finally to the Austro-Prussian war of 1866.</p>

            consists not merely in the secularization of the ecclesiastical
            principalities and corporations, but even still more in the
            alteration caused thereby in the ecclesiastical polity of the
            territorial governments. With the ecclesiastical principalities
            the most powerful props of the Catholic church in Germany were
            lost, and Protestantism obtained a decided ascendency in the
            council of the German princes. The Catholic prelates were now
            simply paid servants of the state, and thus their double
            connexion with the curia and the state brought with it in later
            times endless entanglements and complications. On the other hand,

            Württemberg, Baden, Hesse, there was a great increase of Catholic
            subjects, which attracted but little serious attention when the

            more unassuming and tolerant than ever it has been before or

            of art and science, was made in 1802 Elector of Mainz and Lord
            High Chancellor of the German empire. When by the recess of 1803
            the territories of the electorate on the left of the Rhine were
            given over to France and those on the right secularized, the
            electoral rank was abolished. The same happened with respect to
            the lord high chancellorship through the creation of the Rhenish

            Dalberg was indemnified for the former by the favour of Napoleon
            by the gift of a small territory on the right of the Rhine, and
            for the latter by the renewal of the prince-primacy of the
            Confederation of the Rhine with a seat in the Federal council. He
            still retained his episcopal office and fixed its seat at
            Regensburg. The founding of a metropolitan chapter at Regensburg
            embracing the whole domain of the Rhenish Confederation he did
            not succeed in carrying out, and in 1813 he felt compelled to
            surrender also his territorial possessions. His spiritual
            functions, however, as Archbishop of Regensburg, he continued to
            discharge until his death in 1817.</p>

            Concordat.</span></em>—The Vienna Congress of 1814, 1815, had
            assigned it the difficult task of righting the sorely disturbed
            political affairs of Europe and giving a new shape to the
            territorial and dynastic relations. But never had an
            indispensably necessary redistribution of territory been made
            more difficult or more complicated by diplomatic intrigues than
            in Germany. Instead of the earlier federation of states, the
            restoration of which proved impossible, the federal constitution
            of June 8th, 1815, created under the name of the German
            Confederation a union of states in which all members of the
            confederation as such exercised equal sovereign rights. Their
            number then amounted to thirty-eight, but in the course of time
            by death or withdrawal were reduced to thirty-four. The new
            distribution of territory, just as little as the Luneville Peace,
            took into account confessional homogeneity of princes and
            territories, so that the combination of Catholic and Protestant
            districts with the above referred to consequences, occurred in a
            yet larger measure. But the federal constitution secured in
            Article XVI. full toleration for all Christian confessions in the
            countries of the confederation. The claims of the Romish curia,
            which advanced from the demand for the restoration of all
            ecclesiastical principalities and the return of all impropriated
            churches and monasteries to their original purposes, to the
            demand for the restoration of the holy Roman-German empire in the
            mediæval and hierarchical sense, as well as the solemn protest
            against its conclusions laid upon the table of the congress by
            the papal legate Consalvi, were left quite unheeded. But also a
            proposal urgently pressed by the vicar-general of the diocese of
            Constance, Baron von Wessenberg (<a href="#Section_187_Para_3"
            class="tei tei-ref">§ 187, 3</a>), to found a German Catholic
            national church under a German primate found no favour with the
            congress; and an article recommended by Austria and Prussia to be
            incorporated in the acts of the confederation by which the
            Catholic church in Germany endeavoured to secure a common
            constitution under guarantee of the confederation, was rejected
            through the opposition of Bavaria. And since in the Frankfort
            parliament neither Wessenberg with his primacy and national
            church idea nor Consalvi with a comprehensive <span class=

            "Pg274" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> concordat answering to the
            wishes of the curia, was able to carry through a measure, it was
            left to the separate states interested to make separate
            concordats with the pope. Bavaria concluded a concordat in 1817
            (<a href="#Section_195_Para_1" class="tei tei-ref">§ 195, 1</a>);
            Prussia in 1821 (<a href="#Section_193_Para_1" class=
            "tei tei-ref">§ 193, 1</a>). Negotiations with the other German
            states fell through owing to the excessiveness of the demands of
            the hierarchy, or led to very unsatisfactory results, as in
            Hanover in 1824 (<a href="#Section_194_Para_1" class=
            "tei tei-ref">§ 194, 1</a>) and the states belonging to the
            ecclesiastical province of the Upper Rhine in 1837 (<a href=
            "#Section_196_Para_1" class="tei tei-ref">§ 196, 1</a>). In the
            time of reaction against the revolutionary excesses of 1848 the
            curia first secured any real advance. Hesse-Darmstadt opened the
            list in 1854 with a secret convention (<a href=
            "#Section_196_Para_4" class="tei tei-ref">§ 196, 4</a>); then
            Austria followed in 1855 with a model concordat (<a href=
            "#Section_198_Para_2" class="tei tei-ref">§ 198, 2</a>) which
            served as the pattern for the concordats with Württemberg in 1857
            (<a href="#Section_196_Para_6" class="tei tei-ref">§ 196, 6</a>),
            and with Baden in 1859 (<a href="#Section_196_Para_2" class=
            "tei tei-ref">§ 196, 2</a>), as well as for the episcopal
            convention with Nassau in 1861 (<a href="#Section_196_Para_4"
            class="tei tei-ref">§ 196, 4</a>). But the revived liberal
            current of 1860 swept away the South German concordats; the
            Vatican Council by its infallibility dogma gave the deathblow to
            that of Austria, and the German <span class=

            Bishops' Congress of 1848.</span></em>—As in the March diets of
            1848 the magic word <span class="tei tei-q">“freedom”</span>
            roused through Germany a feverish excitement, it found a ready
            response among the Catholics, whose church was favoured in the
            highest degree by the movement. In the Frankfort parliament the
            ablest leaders of Catholic Germany had seats. Among the Catholic
            population there were numerous religio-political societies formed
            (<a href="#Section_186_Para_3" class="tei tei-ref">§ 186, 3</a>),
            and the German bishops, avowedly for the celebration of the 600th
            anniversary of the building of Cologne cathedral, set alongside
            of the Frankfort people's parliament a German bishops' council.
            After they had at Frankfort declared themselves in favour of
            unconditional liberty of faith, conscience, and worship, the
            complete independence of all religious societies in the ordering
            and administering of their affairs, but also of freeing the
            schools from all ecclesiastical control and oversight, as well as
            of the introduction of obligatory civil marriage, the bishops'
            council met in October at Würzburg under the presidency of
            Archbishop Geissel of Cologne with nineteen episcopal assistants
            and several able theological advisers. In thirty-six sessions
            they reached the conclusion that complete separation between
            church and state is not to be desired so long as the state does
            not refuse to the church the place of authority belonging to it.
            On the other hand, by all means in their power they are to seek
            the abrogation of the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"

            religious instruction in higher schools to be given only by
            teachers licensed for the purpose by the bishops, and finally to
            demand permission to erect educational institutions of their own
            of every kind, etc., and to forward a copy of these decisions to
            all German governments. The main object of the Würzburg assembly
            to secure currency for their resolutions in the new Germany
            sketched out at the Frankfort parliament, was indeed frustrated
            by that parliament's speedy overthrow. Nevertheless in the
            several states concerned it proved of great and lasting
            importance in determining the subsequent unanimous proceedings of

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To the pious
            king Frederick William III. (1797-1840) it was a matter of heart
            and conscience to turn to account the religious consciousness of
            his people, re-awakened by God's gracious help during the war of
            independence, for the healing of the three hundred years' rent in
            the evangelical church by a union of the two evangelical
            confessions. The jubilee festival of the Reformation in 1817
            seemed to him to offer the most favourable occasion. The king
            also desired to see the Catholic church in his dominions restored
            to an orderly and thriving condition, and for this end concluded
            a concordat with Rome in 1821. But it was broken up in 1836 over
            a strife between canon and civil law in reference to mixed
            marriages. Frederick William IV. was dominated by romantic ideas,
            and his reign (1840-1858), notwithstanding all his evangelical
            Christian decidedness, was wanting in the necessary firmness and
            energetic consistency. In the Catholic church the Jesuits were
            allowed unhindered to foster ultramontane hierarchical
            principles, and in the evangelical church the troubles about
            constitution, union, and confession could not be surmounted
            either by its own proper guardian, the episcopate, or by the
            superior church councils created in 1850. And although the
            notifications of William I. on his entrance upon the sole
            government in 1858 were hailed by the liberals as giving
            assurance that a new era <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            evangelical national church, this hope proved to be premature.
            With the exaltation of the victory-crowned royal house of Prussia
            to the throne of the newly erected German Empire on January 18th,
            1871, a new era was actually opened for ecclesiastical
            developments and modifications throughout the land.</p>

            III.</span></em> entered into negotiations with the papal curia,
            not so much for the old provinces in which everything was going
            well, but rather in the interests of the Rhine provinces annexed
            in 1814, whose bishops' sees were vacant or in need of
            circumscription. The first Prussian ambassador to the Roman curia
            (1816-1823) was the famous historian Niebuhr. Although a true
            Protestant and keen critic and restorer of the history of old
            pagan Rome he was no match for the subtle and skilful diplomacy
            of Consalvi. In presence of the claims of the curia he manifested
            to an almost incredible extent trustful sympathy and
            acquiescence, even taking to do with matters that lay outside of
            Prussian affairs, eagerly silencing and opposing any
            considerations suggested from the other side. A complete
            concordat, however, defining in detail all the relations between
            church and state was not secured, but in 1821 an agreement was
            come to, with thankful acknowledgment of the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“great magnanimity and goodness”</span> shown by the
            king, by the bull <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
            xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">De salute
            animarum</span></span>, sanctioned by the king through a cabinet
            order (<span class="tei tei-q">“in the exercise of his royal
            prerogative and without detriment to these rights”</span>),
            according to which two archbishoprics, Cologne and Posen, and six
            bishoprics, Treves, Münster, Paderborn, Breslau, Kulm, and
            Ermeland, with a clerical seminary, were erected in Prussia and
            furnished with rich endowments. The cathedral chapter was to have
            the free choice of the bishop; but by an annexed note it was
            recommended to make sure in every such election that the one so
            chosen would be a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
            xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">grata
            persona</span></span> to the king. The union thus effected
            between church and state was of but short duration. The decree of
            Trent forbade Catholics to enter into mixed marriages with
            non-Catholics. A later papal bull of 1741, however, permitted it
            on condition of an only passive assistance of the clergy at the
            wedding and an engagement by the parents to train up the children
            as Catholics. The law of Prussia, on the other hand, in contested
            cases made all the children follow the religion of their fathers.
            As this was held in 1825 to apply to the Rhine provinces, and as
            the bishops there had, in 1828, appealed to the pope, Pius VIII.
            when negotiations with the Prussian ambassador <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page277">[pg 277]</span><a name="Pg277" id=
            "Pg277" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Bunsen (1824-1838) proved
            fruitless, issued in 1830 a brief which permitted Catholic
            priests to give the ecclesiastical sanction to mixed marriages
            only when a promise was given that the children should be
            educated as Catholics, but otherwise to give only passive
            assistance. When all remonstrances failed to overcome the
            obstinacy of the curia, the government turned to the Archbishop
            of Cologne, Count Spiegel, a zealous friend and promoter of the
            Hermesian theology (<a href="#Section_191_Para_1" class=
            "tei tei-ref">§ 191, 1</a>), and arranged in 1834 a secret
            convention with him, which by his influence all his suffragans
            joined. In it they promised to give such an interpretation to the
            brief that its observance would be limited to teaching and
            exhortation, but would by no means extend to the obligation of
            submitting the children to Catholic baptism, and that the mere
            <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "la"><span style="font-style: italic">assistentia
            passiva</span></span> would be resorted to as rarely as possible,
            and only in cases where absolutely required. Spiegel died in
            November, 1835. In 1836 the Westphalian Baron <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Clement Droste
            von Vischering</span></em> was chosen as his successor. Although
            before his elevation he had unhesitatingly agreed to the
            convention, soon after his enthronization he strictly forbad all
            the clergy celebrating any marriage except in accordance with the
            brief, and blamed himself for having believed the agreement
            between convention and brief affirmed by the government, and
            having only subsequently on closer examination discovered the
            disagreement between the two. At the same time, in order to give
            effect to the condemnation that had been meanwhile passed on the
            Hermesian theology, he gave orders that at the confessional the
            Bonn students should be forbidden to attend the lectures of
            Hermesians. When the archbishop could not be prevailed on to
            yield, he was condemned in 1837 as having broken his word and
            having incited to rebellion, and sent to the fortress of Minden.
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Gregory
            XIV.</span></em> addressed to the consistory a fulminating
            allocution, and a flood of controversial tracts on either side
            swept over Germany. Görres designated the archbishop <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“the Athanasius of the nineteenth century.”</span>
            The government issued a state paper justifying its procedure, and
            the courts of law sentenced certain refractory priests to several
            years' confinement in fortresses or prisons. The moderate
            peaceful tone of the cathedral chapter did much to quell the
            disturbance, supporting as it did the state rather than the
            archbishop. The example of Cologne encouraged also <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Dunin</span></em>, Archbishop of Gnesen and
            Posen, to issue in 1838 a pastoral in which he threatened with
            suspension any priest in his diocese who would not yield
            unconditional obedience to the papal brief. For this he was
            deposed by the civil courts and sentenced to half a year's
            imprisonment in a fortress, but the king prevented the execution
            of the sentence. But Dunin fled from Berlin, whither he had been
            ordered by the king, to Posen, and was then brought in 1839 to
            the fortress of Kolberg. While matters were in this state
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            "Pg278" id="Pg278" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> came to the throne
            in 1840. Dunin was immediately restored, after promising to
            maintain the peace. Droste also was released from his confinement
            with public marks of respect, but received in 1841, with his own
            and the pope's approval, in the former Bishop of Spires, Geissel,
            a coadjutor, who in his name and with the right of succession
            administered the diocese. The government gave no aid to the
            Hermesians. The law in regard to mixed marriages continued indeed
            in force, but was exercised so as to put no constraint of
            conscience upon the Catholic clergy. Of his own accord the king
            declined further exercise of the royal prerogative, allowing the
            bishops direct intercourse with the papal see, whereas previously
            all correspondence had to pass through royal committees, with
            this proviso by the minister Eichhorn, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“that this display of generous confidence be not
            abused,”</span> and with the expectation that the bishops would
            not only communicate to the government the contents of their
            correspondence with the pope, but also the papal replies which
            did not deal exclusively with doctrine, and would not speak and
            act against the wish and will of the government. But Geissel,
            recommended by Louis of Bavaria to his son-in-law Frederick
            William IV. instead of Baron von Diepenbrock (<a href=

            1841-1871.</span></em>—In the Cologne-Posen conflict Rome had won
            an almost complete victory, and with all its satellites now
            thought only of how it might in the best possible manner turn
            this victory to account, in which the all too trustful government
            sought to aid it to the utmost. This movement received a further
            impulse in the revolution of 1848 (<a href="#Section_192_Para_4"
            class="tei tei-ref">§ 192, 4</a>). In Prussia as well as in other
            German lands, and there in a special degree, the Catholic church
            managed to derive from the revolutionary movements of those
            times, and from the subsequent reaction, substantial advantage.
            The constitution of 1850 declared in Article xv.: <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“The evangelical and the Roman Catholic Church as
            well as every other religious society regulates and administers
            its affairs independently”</span>; in Article xvi.: <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“The correspondence of religious societies with their
            superiors is unrestricted, the publication of ecclesiastical
            ordinances is subject only to those limitations which apply to
            all other documents”</span>; in Article xviii.: <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“The right of nomination, proposal, election, and
            institution to spiritual office, so far as it belongs to the
            state, is abolished”</span>; and in Article xxiv.: <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“The respective religious societies direct religious
            instruction in the public schools.”</span> Under the screen of
            these fundamental privileges the Catholic episcopate now claimed
            one civil prerogative after another, emancipated itself wholly
            from the laws of the state, and, on the plea that God must be
            obeyed <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page279">[pg
            279]</span><a name="Pg279" id="Pg279" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            rather than man, made the canon law, not only in purely
            ecclesiastical but also in mixed matters, the only standard, and
            the decision of the pope the final appeal. At last nothing was
            left to the state but the obligation of conferring splendid
            endowments upon the bishops, cathedral chapters, and seminaries
            for priests, and the honour of being at home the executioner of
            episcopal tyranny, and abroad the avenger of every utterance
            unfavourable in the doctrine and worship, customs and enactments
            of the Catholic church. With almost incredible infatuation the
            Catholic hierarchy was now regarded as a main support of the
            throne against the revolutionary tendencies of the age and as the
            surest guarantee for the loyalty of subjects in provinces
            predominantly Catholic. Under protection of the law allowing the
            formation of societies and the right of assembling, the order of
            Jesuits set up one establishment after another, and made up for
            defects or insufficient energy of ultramontane pastoral work,
            agitation and endeavour at conversion on the part of other
            peaceably disposed parish priests, by numerous missions conducted
            in the most ostentatious manner (<a href="#Section_186_Para_6"
            class="tei tei-ref">§ 186, 6</a>). Although according to Article
            xiii. of the constitution religious societies could obtain
            corporative rights only by special enactments, the bishops, on
            their own authority, without regarding this provision,
            established religious orders and congregations wherever they
            chose. As these were generally placed under foreign superiors
            male or female, to whom in Jesuit fashion unconditional obedience
            was rendered, each member being <span class="tei tei-q">“like a
            corpse,”</span> without any individual will, they spread without
            hindrance, so that continually new cloisters and houses of the
            orders sprang up like mushrooms over the Protestant metropolis
            (<a href="#Section_186_Para_2" class="tei tei-ref">§ 186, 2</a>).
            Education in Catholic districts fell more and more into the hands
            of religious corporations, and even the higher state educational
            institutions, so far as they dealt with the training of the
            Catholic youth (theological faculties, gymnasia, and Training
            schools), were wholly under the control of the bishops. From the
            boys' convents and priests' seminaries, erected at all episcopal
            residences, went forth a new generation of clergy reared in the
            severest school of intolerance, who, first of all acting as
            chaplains, by espionage, the arousing of suspicion and
            talebearing, were the dread of the old parish priests, and, as
            <span class="tei tei-q">“chaplains at large,”</span> stirred up
            fanaticism among the people, and secured the Catholic press to
            themselves as a monopoly. For the purposes of Catholic worship
            and education the government had placed state aid most liberally
            at their disposal, without requiring any account from the bishops
            as to their disposal of the money. Although the number of
            Catholics in the whole country was only about half that of the
            Protestants, the endowment of the Catholic was almost double that
            of the evangelical church. The civil authority readily helped the
            bishops to enforce any spiritual <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page280">[pg 280]</span><a name="Pg280" id="Pg280" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> penalties, and thus the inferior clergy
            were brought into absolute dependence upon their spiritual
            superiors. In the government department of Public Worship, from
            1840 to 1848 under the direction of Eichhorn, there was since
            1841 a subsection for dealing with the affairs of the Catholic
            church which, although restricted to the guarding of the rights
            of the king over against the curia and that of the state over
            against the hierarchy, came to be in an entirely opposite sense
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the civil department of the pope in
            Prussia.”</span> Under Von Mühler's ministry, 1862-1872, it
            obtained absolute authority which it seems to have exercised in
            removing unfavourable acts and documents from the imperial
            archives. And thus the Catholic church, or rather the
            ultramontane party dominant in it since 1848, grew up into a
            power that threatened the whole commonwealth in its very
            foundations.—By the annexation of Hanover, Hesse, and Nassau in
            1866, four new bishoprics, those of Hildesheim, Osnabrück, Fulda
            and Limburg were added to the previous eight.—Continuation

            the church should be exercised only in order to secure for it in
            an orderly and legal way the independent administration of its
            own affairs. The realization of this idea, after a church
            conference of the ordinary clergy from almost all German states
            had been held in Berlin without result, was attempted at Berlin
            by a general synod, opened on Whitsunday, 1846. The synod at its
            eighteenth session entered upon the consideration of the
            difficult question of doctrine and the confession. The result of
            this was the approval of an ordination formula drawn up by Dr.
            Nitzsch (<a href="#Section_182_Para_10" class="tei tei-ref">§
            182, 10</a>), according to which the candidate for ordination was
            to make profession of the great fundamental and saving truths
            instead of the church confession hitherto enforced. And since
            among these fundamental truths the doctrines of creation,
            original sin, the supernatural conception, the descent into hell
            and the ascension of Christ, the resurrection of the body, the
            last judgment, everlasting life and everlasting punishment were
            not included, and therefore were not to be enforced, since
            further by this ordination formula the special confessions of
            Lutheran and Reformed were really set aside, and therewith the
            existence of a Lutheran as well as a Reformed church within the
            union seemed to be abolished, a small number of decided Lutherans
            in the synod protested; still more decided and vigorous protests
            arose from outside the synod, to which the <span lang="de" class=

            its columns. The government gave no further countenance to the
            decisions of the synod, and opponents exercised their wit upon

            toleration, by which protection was assured anew to existing
            churches, but the formation of new religious societies was

            xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Itio in
            partes</span></span> thus required in this board, only Dr.
            Nitzsch remained over, as he declared that he could find
            expression for his religious convictions in neither of the two
            confessions, but only in a consensus of both. The difficulty was
            overcome by reckoning him a representative equally of both
            denominations. Encouraged by such connivance in high places to
            entertain still bolder hopes, the Lutheran societies in 1853
            presented to the king a petition signed by one hundred and sixty
            one clergymen, for restoring Lutheran faculties and the Lutheran
            church property. But this called forth a rather unfavourable
            cabinet order, in which the king expressed his disapproval of
            such a misconception of the ordinances of the former year, and
            made the express declaration that it never was his intention to
            break up or weaken the union effected by his father, that he only
            wished to give the confession within the union the protection to
            which it was undoubtedly entitled. After this the separate
            Lutheran interest so long highly favoured fell into manifest and
            growing disfavour. Still the ministerial department of worship
            under <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Von Raumer</span></em>, 1850-1858, continued
            to conduct the affairs of schools and universities in the spirit
            of the ecclesiastical orthodox reaction, and issued the endless
            school regulations conceived in this spirit of the privy
            councillor Stiehl. The Supreme Church Council also exhibited a
            rare activity and passed many wholesome ordinances. <span class=

            "Pg282" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> The evangelical church won
            great credit by the care it took of its members scattered over
            distant lands, in supplying them with clergy and teachers. The
            evident favour with which Frederick William IV. furthered the
            efforts of the Evangelical Alliance of 1857 (<a href=
            "#Section_178_Para_3" class="tei tei-ref">§ 178, 3</a>) was the
            last proof of decided aversion from the confessional movement
            which he was to be allowed to give. A long and hopeless illness,
            of which he died in 1861, obliged him to resign the government to
            his brother <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">William I</span></em>. When this monarch in
            October, 1855, began to rule in his own name, he declared to his
            newly appointed ministers that it was his firm resolve that the
            evangelical union, whose beneficent development had been
            obstructive to an orthodoxy incompatible with the character of
            the evangelical church, and which had thus almost caused its
            ruin, should be maintained and further advanced. But in order
            that the task might be accomplished, the organs for its
            administration must be carefully chosen and to some extent
            changed. All hypocrisy and formalism, which that orthodoxy had
            fostered, is wherever possible to be removed. The <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“new era,”</span> however, marked by the appearance
            of liberal journals, by no means answered to the expectations
            which those words excited. The ministry of <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Von
            Bethmann-Hollweg</span></em>, 1858-1862, filled some theological
            and spiritual offices in this liberal spirit; Stahl withdrew from
            the Supreme Church Council; the proceedings against the free
            churches, as well as the severe measures against the re-marriage
            of divorced parties, were relaxed. But the marriage law laid down
            by the ministry with permission of civil marriage was rejected by
            the House of Peers, and the hated school regulations had to be
            undertaken by the minister himself. The ecclesiastically
            conservative ministry of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Von Mühler</span></em>, 1862-1872, which,
            however, wanted a fixed principle as well as self-determined
            energy of will, and was therefore often vacillating and losing
            the respect of all parties, was utterly unfit to realize these
            expectations. The Supreme Church Council published in 1867 the
            outlines of a provincial synodal constitution for the six East
            Provinces which were still without this institution, which the
            Rhine Provinces and Westphalia had enjoyed since 1835. For this
            purpose he convened in autumn, 1869, an extraordinary provincial
            synod, which essentially approved the sketch submitted, whereupon
            it was provisionally enacted.</p>

            "font-style: italic">The Evangelical Church in Old Prussia,
            1872-1880.</span></em>—After the removal of Von Mühler, the
            minister of worship, in January, 1872, his place was taken by
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Dr.
            Falk</span></em>, 1872-1879. The hated school regulations were
            now at last set aside and replaced by new moderate prescriptions,
            conceived in an almost unexpectedly temperate spirit. On
            September 10th, 1873, the king issued a congregational and
            synodal constitution for the eastern provinces, with the express
            statement that the position <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page283">[pg 283]</span><a name="Pg283" id="Pg283" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> of the confession and the union should
            thereby be in no way affected. It prescribed that in every
            congregation presided over by a pastor, elected by the
            ecclesiastically qualified church members, <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>
            those of honourable life who had taken part in public worship and
            received the sacraments, there should be a church council of from
            four to twelve persons, and for more important matters,
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> the election of a pastor,
            a congregational committee of three times the size, half of which
            should be reappointed every third year. To the district synod,
            presided over by the superintendent, each congregation sends as
            delegates besides the pastor a lay representative chosen by the
            church council from among its members or from the congregational
            committee. According to the same principle the District Synods
            choose from their members a clerical and a lay representative to
            the provincial synod, to which also the evangelical theological
            faculty of the university within the bounds sends a deputy, and
            the territorial lord nominates a number of members not exceeding
            a sixth part of the whole. The general synod, in which also the
            two western provinces, the Rhenish and Westphalian, take part,
            consists of one hundred and fifty delegates from the provincial
            synods, and thirty nominated by the territorial lords, to which
            the faculties of theology and law of the six universities within
            the bounds send each one of their members. Although this royal
            decree had proclaimed itself final, and only remitted to an
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Extraordinary General Synod</span></em> to
            be called forthwith the task of arranging for future ordinary
            general synods, yet at the meeting of this extraordinary synod in
            Berlin, on November 24th, 1875, a draft was submitted of a
            constitution modified in various important points. Of the three
            demands of the liberal party now violently insisted upon—(1)
            Substitution of the <span class="tei tei-q">“filter”</span>
            system in the election of provincial and general synod members
            for that of the community electorate. (2) Strengthening of the
            lay element in all synods; and (3) Abolition of the equality of
            small village communities with large town communities—the first
            was by far the most important and serious in its consequences,
            but the other two bore fruit through the decree that two-thirds
            of the members of the district and provincial synods should be
            laymen, and the other one-third should be freely elected to the
            district synod from the populous town communities, for the
            provincial synods from the larger district synods. Also in
            reference to the rights belonging to the several grades of
            synods, considerable modifications were made, whereby the
            privileges of communities were variously increased (<span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>
            to them was given the right of refusing to introduce the
            catechisms and hymn-books sanctioned by the provincial synods),
            while those of the district and provincial synods were lessened
            in favour of the general synod, and those of the latter again in
            favour of the high church council and <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page284">[pg 284]</span><a name="Pg284" id="Pg284" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> the minister of public worship. After
            nearly four weeks' discussion the bill without any serious
            amendments was passed by the assembly, and on January 20th, 1876,
            received the royal assent and became an ecclesiastical law. But
            in order to give it also the rank of a law of the state, a
            decision of the States' Parliament on the relation of church and
            state was necessary. The parliament had already in 1874, when the
            original congregational and synodal constitution was submitted to
            it, in order to advance the movement, approved only the
            congregational constitution with provisional refusal of
            everything going beyond that. In May, 1876, the bill already
            raised by the king into an ecclesiastical law, passed both houses
            of parliament, and had here also some amendments introduced with
            the effect of increasing and strengthening the prerogative of the
            state. The main points in the law as then passed are these: The
            general synod, whose members undertake to fulfil their duties
            agreeably to the word of God and the ordinances of the
            evangelical national church, has the task of maintaining and
            advancing the state church on the basis of the evangelical
            confession. The laws of the state church must receive its assent,
            but any measure agreed upon by it cannot be laid before the king
            for his sanction without the approval of the minister of public
            worship. It meets every sixth year; in the interval it, as well
            as the provincial synods, is represented by a synodal committee
            chosen from its members. The head of the church government is the
            Supreme Church Council, whose president countersigns the
            ecclesiastical laws approved by the king. The right of appointing
            to this office lies with the minister of public worship; in the
            nomination of other members the president makes proposals with
            consent of the minister. Taxation of the general synod for
            parliamentary purposes needs the assent of the minister of state,
            and must, if it exceeds four per cent. of the class and income
            tax, be agreed to by the Lower House, which also annually has to
            determine the expenditure on ecclesiastical administration.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><a name=

            the extraordinary general synod, the king had repeatedly given
            vigorous expression to his positive religious standpoint, and
            from the proposed lists of members for that synod submitted by
            the minister of public worship all names belonging to the
            <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "de"><span style="font-style: italic">Protestantenverein</span></span>
            were struck out. Still more decidedly in 1877 did he show his
            disapproval in the Rhode-Hossbach troubles (<a href=
            "#Section_180_Para_4" class="tei tei-ref">§ 180, 4</a>), by
            declaring his firm belief in the divinity of Christ, and when the
            then president of the Brandenburg consistory, Hegel, tendered his
            resignation, owing to differences with the liberal president of
            the Supreme Church Council, Hermann, the king refused to accept
            it, because he could not then spare any such men as held by the
            apostolic faith. In May, 1878, Hermann was at last, after
            repeated solicitations, allowed to retire, Dr. Hermes, member
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page285">[pg 285]</span><a name=
            "Pg285" id="Pg285" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of the Supreme
            Church Council, was nominated his successor, and the positive
            tendency of the Supreme Church Council was strengthened by the
            admission of the court preachers, Kögel and Baur. His proposals
            again disagreeing with the royal nominations for the provincial
            synod and for the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">First Ordinary General Synod</span></em> of
            autumn, 1879, led the minister of public worship, Dr. Falk, at
            last, after repeated solicitation, to accept his resignation. It
            was granted him in July, 1879, and the chief president of the
            province of Silesia, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Von Puttkamer</span></em>, a more decided
            adherent of the positive union party, was named as his successor;
            but in June, 1881, he was made minister of the interior, and the
            undersecretary of the department of public worship, <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Von
            Gossler</span></em>, was made minister. The general synod,
            October 10th till November 3rd, consisted of fifty-two
            confessionalists, seventy-six positive-unionists, fifty-six of
            the middle party or evangelical unionist, and nine from the ranks
            of the left, the <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign"
            xml:lang="de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Protestantenverein</span></span>; three
            confessionalists, twelve positive-unionists, and fifteen of the
            middle party were nominated by the king. The measures proposed by
            the Supreme Church Council: (1) A marriage service without
            reference to the preceding civil marriage, with two marriage
            formulæ, the first a joint promise, the second a benediction; (2)
            A disciplinary law against despisers of baptism and marriage,
            which threatened such with the loss of all ecclesiastical
            electoral rights, and eventually with exclusion from the Lord's
            supper and sponsor rights; and (3) A law dealing with <span lang=
            "la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Emeriti</span></span>, were adopted by the
            synod and then approved by the king. On the other hand a series
            of independent proposals conceived in the interests of the
            high-church party remained in suspense. The last effected
            elections for the general synod committee resulted in the
            appointment of three positive-unionist members, including the
            president, two confessionalists, and two of the middle
            party.<a id="noteref_105" name="noteref_105" href=

            Provinces.</span></em>—In 1866 the provinces of Hanover, Hesse
            and Schleswig-Holstein were incorporated with the kingdom of
            Prussia. In these political particularism, combined with
            confessional Lutheranism, suspicion of every organized system of
            church government as intended to introduce Prussian unionism,
            even to the extreme of open rebellion, led to violent conflicts.
            The king, indeed, personally gave assurance in Cassal, Hanover
            and Kiel that the position of the church confession should in no
            way be endangered. <span class="tei tei-q">“He will indeed
            support the union where it already existed as a sacred legacy to
            him from his forefathers; he <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            progress as a witness to the grand unity of the evangelical
            church; but compulsion is to be applied to no man.”</span> The
            consistories of these provinces were still to continue
            independent of the Supreme Church Council. But the ministerial
            order for the restoration of representative synodal constitution
            increasingly prevailed, although the wide-spread suspicion and
            individual protests against the system of church government, such
            as the temporary prohibition of the Marburg consistory of the
            mission festival, as avowedly used for agitation against the
            intended synodal constitution, helped to intensify the bitterness
            of feeling. But on the other hand many preachers by their
            unbecoming pulpit harangues, and their refusal to take the oath
            of allegiance or service, to pray in church for their new
            sovereign, and to observe the general holiday appointed to be
            held in 1869 on November 10th (Luther's birthday), etc.,
            compelled the ecclesiastical authorities to impose fines,
            suspension, penal transportation, and deposition. In the Lutheran
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Schleswig-Holstein</span></em> a new
            congregational constitution was introduced in 1869 by the
            minister Von Mühler, as the basis of a future synodal
            constitution, which was adopted by the <span lang="de" class=

            1871, preserving the confessional status laid down, without
            discussion. In 1878 an advance was made by the institution of
            district or provostship synods, and in February, 1880, the first
            General Synod was held at Rendsburg. As in Old Prussia so also
            here the conservative movement proved victorious. The laity
            obtained majorities in all synods, and the supremacy of the state
            was secured by the subordination of the church government under
            the minister of public worship.</p>

            the question of the constitution only in the end of 1869, after
            the preliminary labour of the national synod committee. In 1882
            the Reformed communities of 120,000 souls, hitherto subject to
            Lutheran consistories, obtained an independent congregational and
            synodal constitution. Against the new marriage ordinance enacted
            in consequence of the civil marriage law (<a href=
            "#Section_197_Para_5" class="tei tei-ref">§ 197, 5</a>), Theod.
            Harms (brother, and from 1865 successor of L. Harms, <a href=
            "#Section_184_Para_1" class="tei tei-ref">§ 184, 1</a>), pastor
            and director of Hermannsburg missionary seminary, rebelled from
            the conviction that civil marriage did not deserve to be
            recognised as marriage. He was first suspended, then in 1877
            deposed from office, and with the most of his congregation
            retired and founded a separate Lutheran community, to which
            subsequently fifteen other small congregations of 4,000 souls
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page287">[pg 287]</span><a name=
            "Pg287" id="Pg287" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> were attached. As
            teacher and pupils of the seminary made it a zealous propaganda
            for the secession, the missionary journals and missionary
            festivals were misused for the same purpose, and as Harms
            answered the questions of the consistory in reference thereto,
            partly by denying, partly by excusing, that court, in December,
            1878, forbad the missionary collections hitherto made throughout
            the churches at Epiphany for Hermannsburg, and so completely
            broke off the connection between the state church and the
            institution which had hitherto been regarded as <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“its pride and its preserving salt.”</span> A
            reaction has since set in in favour of the seminary and its
            friends on the assurance that the interests of the separation
            would not be furthered by the seminary, and that several other
            objectionable features, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            in the mission service of artisans without theological training,
            the sending of them out in too great numbers without sufficient
            endowment and salary, so that missionaries were obliged to engage
            in trade speculations, should be removed as far as possible; but
            since the seminary life was always still carried on upon the
            basis of ecclesiastical secession, it could lead to no permanent
            reconciliation with the state church. Harms died in 1885. His son
            Egmont was chosen his successor, and as the consistory refused
            ordination, he accepted consecration at the hands of five members
            of the Immanuel Synod at Magdeburg.</p>

            Mühler sought to bring about a combination of the three
            consistories of Hanau, Cassel, and Marburg, as a necessary
            vehicle for the introduction of a new synodal constitution. In
            the province itself an agitation was persistently carried on for
            and against the constitutional scheme submitted by the ministers,
            which wholly ignored the old church order (§ 127, 2), which,
            though in the beginning of the seventeenth century through the
            ecclesiastical disturbances of the time (<a href=
            "#Section_154_Para_1" class="tei tei-ref">§ 154, 1</a>), it had
            passed out of use, had never been abrogated and so was still
            legally valid. A <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign"

            "font-style: italic">Vorsynode</span></span> convened in 1870
            approved of it in all essential points, but conventions of
            superintendents, pastoral conferences and lay addresses
            protested, and the Prussian parliament, for which it was not yet
            liberal enough, refused the necessary supplies. As these after
            Von Mühler's overthrow were granted, his successor, Dr. Falk,
            immediately proceeded in 1873 to set up in Cassel the court that
            had been objected to so long. It was constituted after the
            pattern of the Supreme Church Council, of Lutheran, Reformed, and
            United members with <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"

            clergy of Upper Hesse comforted themselves with saying that the
            new courts in which the confessions were combined, if not better,
            were at least no worse than the earlier consistories in which the
            confessions were confounded; and they felt obliged to yield
            obedience to them, so long as they did not <span class=

            the Lutheran confession. On the other hand, many of the clergy of
            Lower Hesse saw in the advance from a merely eventual to an
            actual blending of the confessional status in church government
            an intolerable deterioration. And so forty-five clergyman of
            Lower and one of Upper Hesse laid before the king a protest
            against the innovation as destructive of the confessional rights
            of the Hessian church contrary to the will of the supreme majesty
            of Jesus Christ. They were dismissed with sharp rebuke, and, with
            the exception of four who submitted, were deposed from office for
            obstinate refusal to obey. There were about sixteen congregations
            which to a greater or less extent kept aloof from the new pastors
            appointed by the consistories, and without breaking away from the
            state church wished to remain true to the old pastor <span class=

            autumn, 1884, the movement on behalf of the restoration of a
            presbyterial and synodal constitution of the Hessian evangelical
            church, which had been delayed for fourteen years, was resumed. A
            sketch of a constitution, which placed it under three general
            superintendents (Lutheran, Reformed, United) and thirteen
            superintendents, and, for the fair co-operation of the lay
            element in the administration of church affairs (the confession
            status, however, being beyond discussion), provided suitable
            organs in the shape of presbyteries and synods, with a
            predominance of the lay element, was submitted to a <span lang=

            12th, consisting of two divisions, like a Lower and Upper House,
            sitting together. The first division, as representative of the
            then existing church order, embraced, in accordance with the

            Friesland, the union met with little favour. Yet only in a few of
            those provinces did a sharply marked confessional Lutheranism
            gain wide and general acceptance. This was so especially and most

            hand, since the close of 1860, in almost all those smaller states
            a determined demand was made for a representative synodal
            constitution, securing the due co-operation of the lay
            element.—The Catholic church was strongest in Hanover, and next
            come some parts of Hesse, which had been added to the
            ecclesiastical province of the Upper Rhine (<a href=

            present kingdom of Saxony, formerly an electoral principality,

            "#Section_153_Para_1" class="tei tei-ref">§ 153, 1</a>), but the
            Catholic church could strike its roots again only in the
            immediate neighbourhood of the court. Indeed those belonging to
            it did not enjoy civil and religious equality until 1807, when
            this distinction was set aside. The erection of cloisters and the
            introduction of monkish orders, however, continued even then
            forbidden, and all official publications of the Catholic clergy
            required the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "la"><span style="font-style: italic">placet</span></span> of the
            government. The administration of the evangelical church, so long
            as the king is Catholic, lies, according to agreement, in the
            hands of the ministers commissioned <span lang="la" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">in evangelicis</span></span>. Although
            several of these have proved defenders of ecclesiastical
            orthodoxy, the rationalistic Illumination became almost
            universally prevalent not only among the clergy but also among
            the general populace. Meanwhile a pietistic reaction set in,
            especially powerful in Muldenthal, where Rudelbach's labours
            impressed on it a Lutheran ecclesiastical character. The
            religious movement, on the other hand, directed by Martin
            Stephan, pastor of the Bohemian church in Dresden, came to a sad
            and shameful end. As representative and restorer of strict
            Lutheran views he had wrought successfully in Dresden from 1810,
            but, through the adulation of his followers, approaching even to
            worship, he fell more and more deeply into hierarchical
            assumption and neglect of self-vigilance. When the police in 1837
            restricted his nightly assemblies, without, however, having
            discovered anything immoral, and suspended him from his official
            duties, he called upon his followers to emigrate to America. Many
            of them, lay and clerical, blindly obeyed, and founded in 1835,
            in Missouri, a Lutheran church communion (<a href=
            "#Section_208_Para_2" class="tei tei-ref">§ 208, 2</a>).
            Stephan's despotic hierarchical assumptions here reached their
            fullest height; he also gave his lusts free scope. Women
            oppressed or actually abused by him at length openly proclaimed
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page290">[pg 290]</span><a name=
            "Pg290" id="Pg290" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> his shame in 1839,
            and the community excommunicated him. He died in <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1846. Taught by
            such experiences, and purged of the Donatist-separatist element,
            a church reaction against advancing rationalism made considerable
            progress under a form of church that favoured it, and secured
            also influential representatives in members of the theological
            faculty of the university of Leipzig distinguished for their
            scientific attainments. After repeated debates in the chamber
            over a scheme of a new ecclesiastical and synodal order submitted
            by the ministry, the first evangelical Lutheran state synod met
            in Dresden, in May, 1871. On the motion of the government, the
            law of patronage was here modified so that the patron had to
            submit three candidates to the choice of the ecclesiastical
            board. It was also decided to form an upper or state consistory,
            to which all ecclesiastical matters hitherto administered by the
            minister of public worship should be given over; the control of
            education was to remain with the ministry, and the state
            consistory was to charge itself with the oversight only of
            religious instruction and ethico-religious training. The most
            lively debates were those excited by the proposal to abolish the
            obligation resting upon all church teachers to seem to adhere to
            the confession of the Lutheran church, led by Dr. Zarncke, the
            rector of the state university. The commission of inquiry sent
            down, under the presidency of Professor Luthardt, demanded the
            absolute withdrawal of this proposal, which aimed at perfect
            doctrinal freedom. On the other hand, Professor G. Baur made the
            mediate proposal to substitute for the declaration on oath, the
            promise to teach simply and purely to the best of his knowledge
            and according to conscience the gospel of Christ as it is
            contained in Scripture, and witnessed in the confessions of the
            Lutheran church. And as even now Luthardt, inspired by the wish
            not to rend the first State Synod at its final sitting by an
            incurable schism, agreed to this suggestion, it was carried by a
            large majority. In consequence of this decision, a number of
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Lutherans faithful to the
            confession,”</span> withdrew from the State church, and on the
            anniversary of the Reformation in 1871, constituted themselves
            into an Evangelical Lutheran Free Church, associated with the
            Missouri synod (<a href="#Section_208_Para_2" class=
            "tei tei-ref">§ 208, 2</a>), from which, on the suggestion of
            some of the members of the community who had returned from
            America, they chose for themselves a pastor called Ruhland. There
            were five such congregations in Saxony: at Dresden, Planitz,
            Chemnitz, Frankenberg, and Krimmitschau, to which some South
            German dissenters at Stenden, Wiesbaden, Frankfort, and Anspach
            attached themselves.</p>

            emigration had also decoyed a number of inhabitants from
            Saxe-Altenburg. In a rescript to the Ephorus Ronneburg, in 1838,
            the consistory traced back this separatist movement to the fact
            that the religious needs of the congregations <span class=

            rationalistic preaching, and urged a more earnest presentation
            from the pulpit of the fundamental and central doctrines of
            evangelical Christianity. This rescript was the subject of
            violent denunciation. The government took the opinion of four
            theological faculties on the procedure of the consistory and its
            opponents, who published it simply with the praise and blame
            contained therein, and thus prevented any investigation. Also in

            the rationalism of Röhr and Bretschneider, which had dominated
            almost all pulpits down to the middle of the century, began
            gradually to disappear, and the more recent parties of
            Confessional, Mediation, and Free Protestant theology to take its
            place. The last named party found vigorous support in the
            university of Jena. A petition addressed to it in 1882 from the
            Thuringian Church Conference of Eisenach, to call to Jena also a
            representative of the positive Lutheran theology, was decidedly
            refused, and, in a controversial pamphlet by Superintendent
            Braasch, condemned as <span class="tei tei-q">“the Eisenach

            beyond the reach of legislative interference, but also secured
            its rights to free inquiry. The first State Synod, however, did
            not meet before 1878. In <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            and the legal and actual Lutheran confession of the state church,
            and urged the appointment of Lutheran teachers. The faculty, on
            the other hand, issued a memorial in favour of liberty of public
            teaching, and the curators filled the vacancies again with union
            theologians. When in April, 1862, it was proposed to displace the
            state catechism introduced in 1790, which neither theologically
            nor catechetically satisfied the needs of the church, by a
            carefully sifted revision of the Walther catechism in use before
            1790, approved of by the Göttingen faculty, the agitation of the
            liberal party called forth an opposition, especially in city
            populations, which expressed itself in insults to members of
            consistories and pastors, and in almost daily repeated bloody
            street fights with the military, and obliged the government at
            last to give way.—The negotiations about a concordat with Rome

            1592-1627, had forced upon his territories a modified
            Melanchthonian Calvinism (<a href="#Section_154_Para_1" class=
            "tei tei-ref">§ 154, 1</a>), but a Lutheran basis with Lutheran
            modes of viewing things and Lutheran institutions still remained,
            and the Lutheran reaction had never been completely overcome, not
            even in Lower Hesse, although there the name of the Reformed
            Church with Reformed modes of worship had been gradually
            introduced in most of the congregations. The communities of Upper
            Hesse and Schmalcald, however, by continuous opposition saved for
            the most part their Lutheranism, which in 1648 was guaranteed to
            them anew by the Darmstadt Recess, and secured an independent
            form of church government in the Definitorium at Marburg. The
            union movement, which issued from Prussia in 1817, met with
            favour also in Hesse, but only in the province of Hanau in 1818
            got the length of a formal constituting of a church on the basis
            of the union. In 1821, however, the elector issued the so-called
            Reorganization edict, by which the entire evangelical church of
            the electorate, without any reference to the confession status,
            but simply in accordance with the political divisions of the
            state, was put under the newly instituted consistories of Cassel,
            Marburg, and Hanau, in the formation of which the confession of
            the inhabitants had not been considered. The Marburg Definitorium
            indeed protested, but in vain, against this despotic act, which
            was felt a grievance, less on account of the wiping out of the
            confession than on account of the loss of independent church
            government which it occasioned. The government appointed pastors,
            teachers and professors without enquiring much about their
            confession. In 1838 the hitherto required subscription of the
            clergy to the confessional writings, the Augsburg Confession and
            its Apology, was modified into a formula declaring conscientious
            regard for them. But in this Bickell, professor of law at
            Marburg, saw a loss to the church in legal status, an endangering
            of the evangelical church; the theological professor, Hupfeld,
            also in the further course of the controversy took his side,
            while the advocate, Henkel, in Cassel, as a popular agitator
            opposed him and demanded a State Synod for the formal abolishing
            of all symbolical books. The government ignored both demands, and
            the vehement conflict was quieted by degrees. With 1850 a new era
            began in the keen controversy over the question, which
            confession, whether Lutheran or Reformed, was legally and
            actually that of the state. The ministry of Hassenpflug from
            1850, which suppressed the revolution, considered it as legally
            the Lutheran, and determined the ecclesiastical arrangements in
            this sense, and in this course Dr. Vilmar, member of the
            Consistory, was the minister's right hand. But the elector was
            from <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page293">[pg

            the beginning personally opposed to this procedure, and on the
            overthrow of the ministry in 1855, Vilmar (died 1868) was also
            transferred to a theological professorship at Marburg. This,
            however, only gave a new impulse to the confessional Lutheran
            movement in the state, for the spirit and tendency of the highly
            revered theological teacher powerfully influenced the younger
            generation of the Hessian clergy. In consequence of the German
            war, Hesse was annexed to Prussia in 1866 (<a href=

            Synod, consisting of fourteen clerical and eighteen lay members,
            was to meet every four years, so as not to be a too offensive
            factor in the ecclesiastical administration and legislation,
            which therefore has left untouched the content of the confession.
            The first synod of 1872 began by rejecting the injunction to open
            the sessions with prayer and reading of scripture. <em class=

            catechism of the state church, had gone back to the Heidelberg
            catechism and protested against the abolition of acceptance on
            oath of the symbols, as destructive of the peace of the church.
            The democratic church constitution of 1851, however, was
            abrogated in 1854, and instead of it, the old Reformed church
            order of 1684 was again made law. At the same time, religious
            pardon and equality were guaranteed to Catholics and Lutherans.

            from 1848 was in possession of a strictly Lutheran church
            government under the direction of Kliefoth, and its university at
            Rostock had decidedly Lutheran theologians. When the chamberlain
            Von Kettenburg, on going over to the Catholic church, appointed a
            Catholic priest on his estate, the government in 1852, on the
            ground that the laws of the state did not allow Catholic services
            which extended beyond simple family worship, held <span class=

            out. Even in 1863 the Rostock magistrates refused to allow tower
            and bells in the building of a Catholic church.—An extraordinary
            excitement was caused by the removal from office in January,
            1858, of Professor M. Baumgarten of Rostock. An examination paper
            set by him on 2 Kings xi. by which the endeavour was made to win
            scripture sanction for a violent revolution, obliged the
            government even in 1856 to remove him from the theological
            examination board. At the same time his polemic addressed to a
            pastoral conference at Parchim, against the doctrine of the
            Mecklenburg state catechism on the ceremonial law, especially in
            reference to the sanctification of the Sabbath, increased the
            distrust which the clergy of the state, on account of his
            writings, had entertained against his theological position as one
            which, from a fanatical basis, diverged on all sides into
            fundamental antagonism to the confession and the ordinances of
            the Lutheran state church. The government finally deposed him in
            1858 (leaving him, however, in possession of his whole salary,
            also of the right of public teaching), on the ground and after
            the publication of a judgment of the consistory which found him
            guilty of heretical alteration of all the fundamental doctrines
            of the Christian faith and the Lutheran confession, and sought to
            prove this verdict from his writings. As might have been
            foreseen, this step was followed by a loud outcry by all
            journals; but even Lutherans, like Von Hofmann, Von Scheurl, and
            Luthardt, objected to the proceedings of the government as
            exceeding the law laid down by the ecclesiastical ordinance and
            the opinion of the consistory as resting upon misunderstanding,
            arbitrary supposition and inconsequent conclusion.</p>

            "#Section_165_Para_10" class="tei tei-ref">§ 165, 10</a>), went
            forth again with full sail, under Charles Theodore, 1777-1779, on
            the old course. But the thoroughly new aspect which this state
            assumed on the overthrow of the old German empire, demanded an
            adapting territorially of the civil and ecclesiastical life in
            accordance with the relations which it owed to its present
            political position. The new elector Maximilian Joseph IV., who as
            king styled himself Maximilian I., transferred the execution of
            this task to his liberal, energetic, and thoroughly fearless
            minister, Count Montgelas, 1799-1817. In January, 1802, it was
            enacted that all cloisters should be suppressed, and that all
            cathedral foundations should be secularized; and these enactments
            were immediately carried out in an uncompromising manner. Even in
            1801 the qualification of Protestants to exercise the rights of
            Bavarian citizens was admitted, and a religious edict of 1803
            guaranteed to all Christian confessions full equality of civil
            and political privileges. To the clergy was given the control of
            education, and to the gymnasia and universities a considerable
            number of foreigners and Protestants received appointments. In
            all respects the sovereignty of the state over the church and the
            clergy was very decidedly expressed, the episcopate at all points
            restricted in its jurisdiction, the training of the clergy
            regulated and supervised on behalf of the state, the patronage of
            all pastorates and benefices usurped by the government, even
            public worship subjected to state control by the prohibition
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page296">[pg 296]</span><a name=
            "Pg296" id="Pg296" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of superstitious
            practices, etc. But amid many other infelicities of this
            autocratic procedure was specially the gradual dying out of the
            old race of bishops, which obliged the government to seek again
            an understanding with Rome; and so it actually happened in June,
            1817, after Montgelas' dismissal, that a concordat was drawn up.
            By this the Roman Catholic apostolic religion secured throughout
            the whole kingdom those rights and prerogatives which were due to
            it according to divine appointment and canonical ordinances,
            which, strictly taken, meant supremacy throughout the land. In
            addition, two archbishoprics and seven bishoprics were
            instituted, the restoration of several cloisters was agreed to,
            and the unlimited administration of theological seminaries, the
            censorship of books, the superintendance of public schools and
            free correspondence with the holy see were allowed to the
            bishops. On the other hand, the king was given the choice of
            bishops (to be confirmed by the pope), the nomination of a great
            part of the priests and canons, and the <span lang="la" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">placet</span></span> for all hierarchical
            publications. After many vain endeavours to obtain amendments,
            the king at last, on October 17th, ratified this concordat; but,
            to mollify his highly incensed Protestant subjects, he delayed
            the publication of it till the proclamation of the new civil
            constitution on May 18th following. The concordat was then
            adopted, as an appendage to an edict setting forth the
            ecclesiastical supremacy of the state, securing perfect freedom
            of conscience to all subjects, as well as equal civil rights to
            members of the three Christian confessions, and demanding from
            them equal mutual respect. The irreconcilableness of this edict
            with the concordat was evident, and the newly appointed bishops
            as well as the clerical parliamentary deputies, declared by papal
            instruction that they could not take the oath to the constitution
            without reservation, until the royal statement of Tegernsee,
            September 21st, that the oath taken by Catholic subjects simply
            referred to civil relations, and that the concordat had also the
            validity of a law of the state, induced the curia to agree to it.
            But the government nevertheless continued to insist as before
            upon the supremacy of the state over the church, enlarged the
            claims of the royal <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"

            examinations of the seminarists, made the appointment of all
            clergy dependent on its approbation, and refused to be misled in
            anything by the complaints and objections of the bishops.</p>

            just as little the eagerly sought permission of the return of the
            Jesuits. On the other hand the allied order of Redemptorists was
            allowed, whose missions among the Bavarian people, however, the
            king soon made dependent on a permission to be from time to time
            renewed. His tolerant disposition toward the Protestants was
            shown in 1830, by his refusing the demand of the Catholic clergy
            for a Reverse in mixed marriages, and recognising Protestant
            sponsors at Catholic baptisms. But yet his honourable desire to
            be just even to the Protestants of his realm was often paralysed,
            partly by his own ultramontane sympathies, partly and mainly by
            the immense influence of the Abel ministry, and the religious
            freedom guaranteed them by law in 1818 was reduced and
            restricted. Among other things the Protestant press was on all
            sides gagged by the minister, while the Catholic press and
            preaching enjoyed unbridled liberty. Great as the need was in
            southern Bavaria the government had strictly forbidden the taking
            of any aid from the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Gustavus Adolphus Verein</span></em>. Louis
            saw even in the name of this society a slight thrown on the
            German name, and was specially offended at its vague, nearly
            negative attitude towards the confession. Yet he had no
            hesitation in affording an asylum in Catholic Bavaria to the
            Lutheran confessor Scheibel (<a href="#Section_177_Para_2" class=
            "tei tei-ref">§ 177, 2</a>) whom Prussian diplomacy had driven
            out of Lutheran Saxony, and did not prevent the university of
            Erlangen, after its dead orthodoxy had been reawakened by the
            able Reformed preacher Krafft (died 1845), becoming the centre of
            a strict Lutheran church consciousness in life as well as science
            for all Germany. The adoration order of 1838, which required even
            the Protestant soldiers to kneel before the host as a military
            salute, occasioned great discontent among the Protestant
            population, and many controversial pamphlets appeared on both
            sides. When finally the parliament in 1845 took up the complaint
            of the Protestants, a royal proclamation followed by which the
            usually purely military salute formerly in use was restored. In
            1847 the ultramontane party, with Abel at its head, fell into
            disfavour with the king, on account of its honourable attitude in
            the scandal which the notorious Lola Montez caused in the circle
            of the Bavarian nobility; but in 1848 Louis was obliged, through
            the revolutionary storm that burst over Bavaria, to resign the
            crown.</p>

            at Freysing, in November, 1850, presented a memorial, in which
            they <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page298">[pg

            constitution of 1818, as in all respects prejudicial to the
            rights of the church granted by the concordat, and set forth in
            particular those points which were most restrictive to the free
            and proper development of the catholic church. The result was the
            publication in April, 1852, of a rescript which, while
            maintaining all the principles of state administration hitherto
            followed, introduced in detail various modifications, which, on
            the renewal of the complaints in 1854, were somewhat further
            increased as the fullest and final measure of surrender.—The
            change brought about in 1866 in the relation of Bavaria to North
            Germany led the government under Louis II. to introduce liberal
            reforms, and the offensive and defensive alliance which the
            government concluded with the heretical Prussia, the failure of
            all attempts on the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian war to force
            it in violation of treaty to maintain neutrality, and then to
            prevent Bavaria becoming part of the new German empire founded in
            1871 at the suggestion of her own king, roused to the utmost the
            wrath of the Bavarian clerical patriots. In the conflicts of the
            German government, in 1872, against the intolerable assumptions,
            claims and popular tumults of the ultramontane clergy, the
            department of public worship, led by Lutz, inclined to take an
            energetic part. But this was practically limited to the passing

            Church.</span></em>—Since 1852, Dr. von Harless (<a href=
            "#Section_182_Para_13" class="tei tei-ref">§ 182, 13</a>), as
            president of the upper consistory at Munich, stood at the head of
            the Lutheran church of Bavaria. Under his presidency the general
            synod at Baireuth in 1853 showed a vigorous activity in the
            reorganization of the church. On the basis of its proceedings the
            upper consistory ordered the introduction of an admirable new
            hymnbook. This occasioned considerable disagreement. But when, in
            1856, the upper consistory issued a series of enactments on
            worship and discipline, a storm, originating in Nuremberg, burst
            forth in the autumn of that same year, which raged over the whole
            kingdom and attacked even the state church itself. The king was
            assailed with petitions, and the spiritual courts went so far in
            faint-heartedness as to put the acceptance and non-acceptance of
            its ordinances to the vote of the congregations. Meanwhile the
            time had come for calling another general synod (1857). An order
            of the king as head of the church abolished the union of the two
            state synods in a general synod which had existed since 1849, and
            forbad all discussion of matters of discipline. Hence instead of
            one, two synods assembled, the one in October at Anspach, the
            other in November at Baireuth. Both, consisting of equal numbers
            of lay and clerical members, maintained a moderate attitude,
            relinquishing none of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page299">[pg 299]</span><a name="Pg299" id="Pg299" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> privileges of the church or the
            prerogatives of the upper consistory, and yet contributed greatly
            to the assuaging of the prevalent excitement. Also the lay and
            clerical members of the subsequent reunited general synods held
            every fourth year for the most part co-operated successfully on
            moderate church lines. The synod held at Baireuth in 1873
            unanimously rejected an address sent from Augsburg inspired by
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Protestant Union”</span> sympathies, as
            to their mind <span class="tei tei-q">“for the most part

            Rhine</span></em> the union had been carried out in 1818 on the
            understanding that the symbolical books of both confessions
            should be treated with due respect, but no other standard
            recognised than holy scripture. When therefore the Erlangen
            professor, Dr. Rust, in 1832 appeared in the consistory at Spires
            and the court for that time had endeavoured to fill up the
            Palatine union with positive Christian contents, 204 clerical and
            lay members of the Diocesan Synod presented to the assembly of
            the states of the realm, opportunely meeting in 1837, a complaint
            against the majority of the consistory. As this memorial yielded
            practically no result, the opposition wrought all the more
            determinedly for the severance of the Palatine church from the
            Munich Upper Consistory. This was first accomplished in the
            revolutionary year 1848. An extraordinary general synod brought
            about the separation, and gave to the country a new democratic
            church constitution. But the reaction of the blow did not stop
            there. The now independent consistory at Spires, from 1853 under
            the leadership of Ebrard, convened in the autumn of that year a
            general synod, which made the <span lang="la" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Augustana Variata</span></span> of 1540 as
            representing the consensus between the <span lang="la" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Augustana</span></span> of 1530 and the
            Heidelberg as well as the Lutheran catechism, the confessional
            standard of the Palatine church, and set aside the democratic
            election law of 1848. When now the consistory, purely at the
            instance of the general synod of 1853, submitted to the diocesan
            synod in 1856 the proofs of a new hymnbook, the liberal party
            poured out its bitter indignation upon the system of doctrine
            which it was supposed to favour. But the diocesan synods admitted
            the necessity of introducing a new hymnbook and the suitability
            of the sketch submitted, recommending, however, its further
            revision so that the recension of the text might be brought up to
            date and that an appendix of 150 new hymns might be added. The
            hymnbook thus modified was published in 1859, and its
            introduction into church use left to the judgment of
            presbyteries, while its use in schools and in confirmation
            instruction was insisted upon forthwith. This called forth
            protest after protest. The government wished from the first to
            support the synodal decree, but in presence of growing
            disturbance, changed its attitude, recommended the consistory
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page300">[pg 300]</span><a name=
            "Pg300" id="Pg300" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to observe decided
            moderation so as to restore peace, and in February, 1861, called
            a general synod which, however, in consequence of the
            prevailingly strict ecclesiastical tendencies of its members,
            again expressed itself in favour of the new hymnbook. Its
            conclusions were meanwhile very unfavourably received by the
            government. Ebrard sought and obtained liberty to resign, and
            even at the next synod, in 1869, the consistory went hand in hand
            with the liberal majority.</p>

            princely houses of South Germany had by the Lüneville Peace
            obtained such an important increase of Catholic subjects, that

            relations by concluding a concordat with the papal curia in a
            manner satisfactory to state and church. But all negotiations
            broke down before the exorbitant claims of Rome, until the
            political restoration movements of 1850 led to modifications of
            them hitherto undreamed of. The concordats concluded during this
            period were not able to secure enforcement over against the
            liberal current that had set in with redoubled power in 1860, and
            so one thing after another was thrown overboard. Even in the
            Protestant state churches this current made itself felt in the
            persistent efforts, which also proved successful, to secure the
            restoration of a representative synodal constitution which would
            give to the lay element in the congregations a decided

            that the choice of the bishops should issue indeed from the
            chapter, but that the territorial lord might strike out
            objectionable names in the list of candidates previously
            submitted to him. The actual equality of Protestants and
            Catholics which the pope had not been able to allow in the
            concordat, was now in 1880 proclaimed by the princes as the law
            of the land. Papal and episcopal indulgences had to receive
            approval before their publication; provincial and diocesan synods
            could be held only with approval of the government and in
            presence of the commissioners of the prince; taxes could not be
            imposed by any ecclesiastical court; appeal could be made to the
            civil court against abuse of spiritual power; those preparing for
            the priesthood should receive scientific training at the
            universities, practical training in the seminaries for priests,
            etc. The pope issued a brief in which he characterized these
            conditions as scandalous novelties, and reminded the bishops of
            Acts v. 29. But only the Bishop of Fulda followed this advice,
            with the result that the Catholic theological faculty at Marburg
            was after a short career closed again, and the education of the
            priests given over to the seminary at Fulda. Hesse-Darmstadt
            founded a theological faculty at Giessen in 1830; Baden had one
            already in Freiburg, and Würtemberg had in 1817 affiliated the
            faculty at Ellwanger with the university of Tübingen, and endowed
            it with the revenues of a rich convent. In all these faculties
            alongside of rigorous scientific exactness there prevailed a
            noble liberalism without the surrender of the fundamental
            Catholic faith. The revolutionary year, 1848, first gave the
            bishops the hope of a successful struggle for the unconditional
            freedom of the church. In order to enforce the Würzburg decrees
            (<a href="#Section_192_Para_4" class="tei tei-ref">§ 192, 4</a>),
            the five bishops issued in 1851 a joint memorial. As the
            governments delayed their answer, they declared in 1852 that they
            would immediately act as if all had been granted them; and when
            at last the answer came, on most points unfavourable, they said
            in 1853, that, obeying God rather than man, they would proceed
            wholly in accordance with canon law.</p>

            its clergy, the place best fitted for such an attempt. The
            Archbishop of Freiburg, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Herm. von Vicari</span></em>, in 1852, now
            in his eighty-first year, began by arbitrarily stopping, on the
            evening of May 9th, the obsequies of the deceased grand-duke
            appointed by the Catholic Supreme Church Council for May 10th,
            prohibiting at the same time the saying of mass for the dead
            (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=

            "tei tei-anchor"></a> Catholic burials, but in Baden and Bavaria
            hitherto not refused even to Protestant princes. More than one
            hundred priests, who disobeyed the injunction, were sentenced to
            perform penances. In the following year he openly declared that
            he would forthwith carry out the demands of the episcopal
            memorial, and did so immediately by appointing priests in the
            exercise of absolute authority; and by holding entrance
            examinations to the seminary without the presence of royal
            commissioners as required by law. As a warning remained unheeded,
            the government issued the order that all episcopal indulgences
            must before publication be subscribed by a grand-ducal special
            commissioner appointed for the purpose. Against him, as well as
            against all the members of the Supreme Church Council, the
            archbishop proclaimed the ban, issued a fulminating pastoral
            letter, which was to have been read with the excommunication in
            all churches, and ordered preaching for four weeks for the
            instruction of the people on these matters. At the same time he
            solemnly protested against all supremacy of the state over the
            church. The government drove the Jesuits out of the country,
            forbad the reading of the pastoral, and punished disobedient
            priests with fines and imprisonment. But the archbishop, spurred
            on by Ketteler, Bishop of Mainz, advanced more boldly and
            recklessly than ever. In May, 1854, the government introduced a
            criminal process against him, during the course of which he was
            kept prisoner in his own house. The attempts of his party to
            arouse the Catholic population by demonstrations had no serious
            result. At the close of the investigation the archbishop was
            released from his confinement and continued the work as before.
            The government, however, still remained firm, and punished every
            offence. In June, 1855, however, a provisional agreement was
            published, and finally in June, 1859, a formal concordat, the
            bull <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "la"><span style="font-style: italic">Æterni
            patris</span></span>, was concluded with Rome, its concessions to
            the archbishop almost exceeding even those of Austria (<a href=
            "#Section_198_Para_2" class="tei tei-ref">§ 198, 2</a>). In spite
            of ministerial opposition the second chamber in March, 1860,
            brought up the matter before its tribunal, repudiated the right
            of the government to conclude a convention with Rome without the
            approbation of the states of the realm, and forbad the grand-duke
            to enforce it. He complied with this demand, dismissed the
            ministry, insisted, in answer to the papal protest, on his
            obligation to respect the rights of the constitution, and on
            October 9th, 1860, sanctioned jointly with the chambers a law on
            the legal position of the Catholic and Protestant churches in the
            state. The archbishop indeed declared that the concordat could
            not be abolished on one side, and still retain the force of law,
            but in presence of the firm attitude of the government he
            desisted, and satisfied himself with giving in 1861 a grudging
            acquiescence, by which he secured to himself greater independence
            than before in regard to imposing of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page303">[pg 303]</span><a name="Pg303" id="Pg303" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> dues and administration of the church
            property. Conflicts with the archbishop, however, and with the
            clerical minority in the chamber, still continued. The archbishop
            died in 1868. His see remained vacant, as the chapter and the
            government could not agree about the list of candidates; the
            interim administration was carried on by the vicar-general, Von
            Kübel (died 1881), as administrator of the archdiocese, quite in
            the spirit of his predecessor. The law of October 9th, 1860, had
            prescribed evidence of general scientific culture as a condition
            of appointment to an ecclesiastical office in the Protestant as
            well as the Catholic church. Later ordinances required in
            addition: Possession of Baden citizenship, having passed a
            favourable examination on leaving the university, a university
            course of at least two and half years, attendance upon at least
            three courses of lectures in the philosophical faculty, and
            finally also an examination before a state examining board,
            within one and half years of the close of the university
            curriculum, in the Latin and Greek languages, history of
            philosophy, general history, and the history of German literature
            (later also the so called <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign"
            xml:lang="de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Kulturexamen</span></span>). The Freiburg
            curia, however, protested, and in 1867 forbad clergy and
            candidates to submit to this examination or to seek a
            dispensation from it. The result was, that forthwith no clergymen
            could be definitely appointed, but up to 1874 no legal objection
            was made to interim appointments of parochial administrators. The
            educational law of 1868 abolished the confessional character of
            the public schools. In 1869 state recognition was withdrawn from
            the festivals of Corpus Christi, the holy apostles, and Mary, as
            also, on the other hand, from the festivals of Maundy Thursday
            and Good Friday. In 1870 obligatory civil marriage was
            introduced, while all compulsion to observe the baptismal,
            confirmational, and funeral rites of the church was abolished,
            and a law on the legal position of benevolent institutions was
            passed to withdraw these as much as possible from the
            administration of the ecclesiastical authorities. On the
            subsequent course of events in Baden, see <a href=

            Baden.</span></em>—The union of the Lutheran and Reformed
            churches was carried out in the Grand Duchy of Baden in 1821. It
            recognised the normative significance of the <span lang="la"
            class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Augustana</span></span>, as well as the
            Lutheran and Heidelberg catechisms, in so far as by it the free
            examination of scripture as the only source of Christian faith,
            is again expressly demanded and applied. A synod of 1834 provided
            this state church with union-rationalistic agenda, hymnbook, and
            catechism. When there also a confessional Lutheran sentiment
            began again in the beginning of 1850 to prevail, the church of
            the union opposed this movement by gensdarmes, imprisonment and
            fines. The pastor Eichhorn, and later also the pastor Ludwig,
            with <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page304">[pg
            304]</span><a name="Pg304" id="Pg304" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            a portion of their congregations left the state church and
            attached themselves to the Breslau Upper Church Conference, but
            amid police interference could minister to their flocks only
            under cloud of night. After long refusal the grand-duke at last
            in 1854 permitted the separatists the choice of a Lutheran
            pastor, but persistently refused to recognise Eichhorn as such.
            Pastor Haag, who would not give up the Lutheran distribution
            formula at the Lord's supper, was after solemn warning deposed in
            1855. On the other hand the positive churchly feeling became more
            and more pronounced in the state church itself. In 1854 the old
            rationalist members of the Supreme Church Council were silenced,
            and Ullmann of Heidelberg was made president. Under his auspices
            a general synod of 1855 presented a sketch of new church and
            school books on the lines of the union consensus, with an
            endeavour also to be just to the Lutheran views. The grand-duke
            confirmed the decision and the country was silent. But when in
            1858 the Supreme Church Council, on the ground of the Synodal
            decision of 1855, promulgated the general introduction of a new
            church book, a violent storm broke out through the country
            against the liturgical novelties contained therein (extension of
            the liturgy by confession of sin and faith, collects, responses,
            Scripture reading, kneeling at the supper, the making a
            confession of their faith by sponsors), the Heidelberg faculty,
            with Dr. Schenkel at its head, leading the opposition in the
            Supreme Church Council. Yet Hundeshagen, who in the synod had
            opposed the introduction of a new agenda, entered the lists
            against Schenkel and others as the apologist of the abused church
            book. The grand-duke then decided that no congregation should be
            obliged to adopt the new agenda, while the introduction of the
            shorter and simpler form of it was recommended. The agitations
            these awakened caused its rejection by most of the congregations.
            Meanwhile in consequence of the concordat revolution in 1860, a
            new liberal ministry had come into power, and the government now
            presented to the chambers a series of thoroughly liberal schemes
            for regulating the affairs of the evangelical church, which were
            passed by large majorities. Toward the end of the year the
            government, by deposing the Supreme Church Councillor Heintz
            began to assume the patronage of the supreme ecclesiastical
            court. Ullmann and Bähr tendered their resignations, which were
            accepted. The new liberal Supreme Church Council, including
            Holtzmann, Rothe, etc., now published a sketch of a church
            constitution on the lines of ecclesiastical constitutionalism,
            which with slight modifications the synod of July, 1861, adopted
            and the grand-duke confirmed. It provided for annual diocesan
            synods of lay and clerical members, and a general synod every
            five years. The latter consists of twenty-four clerical and
            twenty-four lay members, and six chosen by the grand-duke,
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page305">[pg 305]</span><a name=
            "Pg305" id="Pg305" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> besides the
            prelate, and is represented in the interval by a standing
            committee of four members, who have also a seat and vote in the
            Supreme Church Council.—Dr. Schenkel's <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“<span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "de"><span style="font-style: italic">Leben
            Jesu</span></span>”</span> of 1864 led the still considerable
            party among the evangelical clergy who adhered to the doctrine of
            the church to agitate for his removal from his position as
            director of the Evangelical Pastors' Seminary at Heidelberg; but
            it resulted only in this, that no one was obliged to attend his
            lectures. The second synod, held almost a year behind time in
            1867, passed a liberal ordination formula. At the next synod in
            1871, the orthodox pietistic party had evidently become stronger,
            but was still overborne by the liberal party, whose strength was
            in the lay element. Meanwhile a praiseworthy moderation prevailed
            on both sides, and an effort was made to work together as
            peaceably as possible.—In Heidelberg a considerable number
            attached to the old faith, dissatisfied with the preaching of the
            four <span class="tei tei-q">“Free Protestant”</span> city
            pastors, after having been in 1868 refused their request for the
            joint use of a city church for private services in accordance
            with their religious convictions (<a href="#Section_180_Para_1"
            class="tei tei-ref">§ 180, 1</a>), had built for this purpose a
            chapel of their own, in which numerously attended services were
            held under the direction of Professor Frommel of the gymnasium.
            When a vacancy occurred in one of the pastorates in 1880, this
            believing minority, anxious for the restoration of unity and
            peace, as well as the avoidance of the separation, asked to have
            Professor Frommel appointed to the charge. At a preliminary
            assembly of twenty-one liberal church members this proposal was
            warmly supported by the president, Professor Bluntschli, by all
            the theological professors, with the exception of Schenkel and
            eighteen other liberal voters, and agreed to by the majority of
            the two hundred liberals constituting the assembly. But when the
            formal election came round the proposal was lost by twenty-seven
            to fifty-one votes.</p>

            1819 the government of the Grand Duchy of <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Hesse</span></em>
            recommended the union of all <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Protestant</span></em>
            communities under one confession. Rhenish Hesse readily agreed to
            this, and there in 1822 the union was accomplished. In the other
            provinces, however, it did not take effect, although by the
            rationalism fostered at Giessen among the clergy and by the
            popular current of thought in the communities, the Lutheran as
            well as the Reformed confession had been robbed of all
            significance. But since 1850 even there a powerful Lutheran
            reaction among the younger clergy, zealously furthered by a
            section of the aristocracy of the state, set in, especially in
            the district on the right bank of the Rhine, which has eagerly
            opposed the equally eager struggles of the liberal party to
            introduce a liberal synodal representative constitution for the
            evangelical church of the whole state. These endeavours, however,
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page306">[pg 306]</span><a name=
            "Pg306" id="Pg306" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> were frustrated,
            and at an extraordinary state synod of 1873, on all controverted
            questions, the middle party gave their vote in favour of the
            absorptive union. The state church was declared to be the united
            church. The clause that had been added to the government
            proposal: <span class="tei tei-q">“Without prejudice to the
            status of the confessions of the several communities,”</span> was
            dropped; the place of residence and not the confession was that
            which determined qualifications in the community; the ordination
            now expressed obligation to the Reformation confessions
            generally, etc. The members of the minority broke off their
            connection with the synod, and seventy-seven pastors presented to
            the synod a protest against its decisions. The grand-duke then,
            on the basis of these deliberations, gave forthwith a charter to
            the church constitution, in which indeed the Lutheran, Reformed,
            and United churches were embraced in one evangelical state church
            with a common church government; but still also, by restoring the
            phrase struck out by the synod from § 1, the then existing
            confessional status of the several communities was preserved and
            the confession itself declared beyond the range of legislation.
            Yet fifteen Lutheran pastors represented that they could not
            conscientiously accept this, and the upper consistory hastened to
            remove them from office shortly before the shutting of the gates,
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            "tei tei-ref">§ 197, 15</a>) depositions of clergy would belong
            only to the supreme civil court. The opposing congregations now
            declared, in 1877, their withdrawal from the state church, and
            constituted themselves as a <span class="tei tei-q">“free
            Lutheran church in Hesse.”</span>—The <em class=

            Duchy of Hesse, had under the peaceful bishops of Mainz, Burg
            (died 1833) and Kaiser (died 1849), caused the government no
            trouble. But it was otherwise after Kaiser's death. Rome rejected
            Professor Leopold Schmid of Giessen, favoured at Darmstadt and
            regularly elected by the chapter (<a href="#Section_187_Para_3"
            class="tei tei-ref">§ 187, 3</a>), and the government yielded to
            the appointment of the violent ultramontane Westphalian, Baron
            von Ketteler. His first aim was the extinction of the Catholic
            faculty at Giessen (<a href="#Section_191_Para_2" class=
            "tei tei-ref">§ 191, 2</a>); he rested not until the last student
            had been transferred from it to the newly erected seminary at
            Mainz (1851). No less energetic and successful were his
            endeavours to free the Catholic church from the supremacy of the
            state in accordance with the Upper Rhenish episcopal memorial.
            The Dalwigk ministry, in 1854, concluded a <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“provisional agreement”</span> with the bishop, which
            secured to him unlimited autonomy and sovereignty in all
            ecclesiastical matters, and, to satisfy the pope with his
            desiderata, these privileges were still further extended in 1856.
            To this convention, first made publicly known in 1860, the
            ministry, in spite of all addresses and protests, adhered with
            unfaltering tenacity, although long convinced of its
            consequences. The political events of 1886, however, led the
            grand-duke <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page307">[pg
            307]</span><a name="Pg307" id="Pg307" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            in September of that year to abrogate the hateful convention. But
            the minister as well as the bishop considered this merely to
            refer to the episcopal convention of 1850, and treated the
            agreement with the pope of 1856 as always still valid. So
            everything went on in the old way, even after Ketteler's supreme
            influence in the state had been broken by the overthrow of
            Dalwigk in 1871. Comp. <a href="#Section_197_Para_15" class=

            union in 1817. The conflict in the Upper Rhenish church
            overflowed even into this little province. The Bishop of Limburg,
            in opposition to law and custom, appointed Catholic clergy on his
            own authority, and excommunicated the Catholic officers who
            supported the government, while the government arrested the
            temporalities and instituted criminal proceedings against bishop
            and chapter. After the conclusion of the Württemberg and Baden
            concordats, the government showed itself disposed to adopt a
            similar way out of the conflict, and in spite of all opposition
            from the States concluded in 1861 a convention with the bishop,
            by which almost all his hierarchical claims were admitted. Thus
            it remained until the incorporation of Nassau in the Prussian
            kingdom in 1866.</p>

            "font-style: italic">Protestant Württemberg</span></em> a
            religious movement among the people reached a height such as it
            attained nowhere else. Pietism, chiliasm, separatism, the holding
            of conventicles, etc., assumed formidable dimensions; solid
            science, philosophical culture, and then also philosophical and
            destructive critical tendencies issuing from Tübingen affected
            the clergy of this state. Dissatisfaction with various novelties
            in the liturgy, the hymnbook, etc., led many formally to separate
            from the state church. After attempts at compulsion had proved
            fruitless, the government allowed the malcontents under the
            organizing leadership of the burgomaster, G. W. Hoffman (died
            1846), to form in 1818 the community of Kornthal, with an
            ecclesiastical and civil constitution of its own after the
            apostolic type. Others emigrated to South Russia and to North
            America (§ 211, <a href="#Section_211_Para_6" class=
            "tei tei-ref">6</a>, <a href="#Section_211_Para_7" class=

            Blumhardt at Möttlingen, who earnestly preached repentance, there
            was developed, in connection with the healing of a demoniac,
            which had been accompanied with a great awakening in the
            community, the <span class="tei tei-q">“gift”</span> of healing
            the sick by absolution and laying on of hands with contrite
            believing prayer. Blumhardt, in order to afford this gift
            undisturbed exercise, bought the Bad Boll near Göppingen, and
            officiated there as pastor and miraculous healer in the way
            described. He died in 1880.—After the way to a synodal
            representation of the whole evangelical state church had been
            opened up in 1851 by the introduction, according to a royal
            ordinance, of parochial councils and diocesan synods, the
            consistory having also in 1858 published a scheme referring
            thereto, the whole <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page308">[pg
            308]</span><a name="Pg308" id="Pg308" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            business was brought to a standstill, until at last in 1867, by
            means of a royal edict, the calling of a State Synod consisting
            of twenty-five clerical and as many lay members was ordered, and
            consequently in February, 1869, such a synod met for the first
            time. Co-operation in ecclesiastical legislation was assigned to
            it as its main task, while it had also the right to advise in
            regard to proposals about church government, also to make
            suggestions and complaints on such matters, but the confession of
            the evangelical church was not to be touched, and lay entirely
            outside of its province. A liberal enactment with regard to
            dissenters was sanctioned by the chamber in 1870.</p>

            Württemberg.</span></em>—Even after the founding of the bishopric
            of Rottenberg the government maintained strictly the previously
            exercised rights of sovereignty over the Catholic church, to
            which almost one-third of the population belonged, and the almost
            universally prevalent liberalism of the Catholic clergy found in
            this scarcely any offence. A new order of divine service in 1837,
            which, with the approval of the episcopal council, recommended
            the introduction of German hymns in the services, dispensing the
            sacraments in the German language, restriction of the festivals,
            masses, and private masses, processions, etc., did indeed cause
            riots in several places, in which, however, the clergy took no
            part. But when in 1837, in consequence of the excitement caused
            throughout Catholic Germany by the Cologne conflict (<a href=
            "#Section_193_Para_1" class="tei tei-ref">§ 193, 1</a>), the
            hitherto only isolated cases of lawless refusal to consecrate
            mixed marriages had increased, the government proceeded severely
            to punish offending clergymen, and transported to a village
            curacy a Tübingen professor, Mack, who had declared the
            compulsory celebration unlawful. Called to account by the nuncio
            of Munich for his indolence in all these affairs and severely
            threatened, old Bishop Keller at last resolved, in 1841, to lay
            before the chamber a formal complaint against the injury done to
            the Catholic church, and to demand the freeing of the church from
            the sovereignty of the state. In the second chamber this motion
            was simply laid <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "la"><span style="font-style: italic">ad acta</span></span>, but
            in the first it was recommended that the king should consider it.
            The bishop, however, and the liberal chapter could not agree as
            to the terms of the demand, contradictory opinions were
            expressed, and things remained as they were. But Bishop Keller
            fell into melancholy and died in 1845. His successor took his
            stand upon the memorial and declaration of the Upper Rhenish
            bishops, and immediately in 1853 began the conflict by forbidding
            his clergy, under threats of severe censure, to submit as law
            required to civil examinations. The government that had hitherto
            so firmly maintained its sovereign rights, under pressure of the
            influence which a lady very nearly related to the king exercised
            over him, gave in without more ado, quieted the bishop first of
            all by <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page309">[pg
            309]</span><a name="Pg309" id="Pg309" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            a convention in 1854, and then entered into negotiations with the
            Roman curia, out of which came in 1857 a concordat proclaimed by
            the bull <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "la"><span style="font-style: italic">Cum in
            sublimi</span></span>, which, in surrender of a sovereign right
            of the state over the affairs of the church, far exceeds that of
            Austria (<a href="#Section_198_Para_2" class="tei tei-ref">§ 198,
            2</a>). The government left unheeded all protests and petitions
            from the chambers for its abolition. But the example of Baden and
            the more and more decided tone of the opposition obliged the
            government at last to yield. The second chamber in 1861 decreed
            the abrogation of the concordat, and a royal rescript declared it
            abolished. In the beginning of 1862 a bill was submitted by the
            new ministry and passed into law by both chambers for determining
            the relations of the Catholic church to the state. The royal
            <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "la"><span style="font-style: italic">placet</span></span> or
            right of permitting or refusing, is required for all clerical
            enactments which are not purely inter-ecclesiastical but refer to
            mixed matters; the theological endowments are subject to state
            control and joint administration; boys' seminaries are not
            allowed; clergymen appointed to office must submit to state
            examination; according to consuetudinary rights, about two-thirds
            of the benefices are filled by the king, one-third by the bishops
            on reporting to the civil court, which has the right of protest;
            clergy who break the law are removable by the civil court, etc.
            The curia indeed lodged a protest, but the for the most part
            peace-loving clergy reared, not in the narrowing atmosphere of
            the seminaries but amid the scientific culture of the university,
            in the halls of Tübingen, submitted all the more easily as they
            found that in all inter-ecclesiastical matters they had greater
            freedom and independence under the concordat than before.</p>

            Lorraine had again, in consequence of the Franco-Prussian war,
            been united to Germany and as an imperial territory had been
            placed under the rule of the new German emperor, the secretary of
            the Papal States, Cardinal Antonelli, in the confident hope of
            being able to secure in return the far more favourable
            conditions, rights and claims of the Catholic church in Prussia
            with the autocracy of the bishops unrestricted by the state,
            declared in a letter to the Bishop of Strassburg, that the
            concordat of 1801 (<a href="#Section_203_Para_1" class=
            "tei tei-ref">§ 203, 1</a>) was annulled. But when the imperial
            government showed itself ready to accept the renunciation, and to
            make profit out of it in the opposite way from that intended, the
            cardinal hasted in another letter to explain how by the
            incorporation with Germany a new arrangement had become
            necessary, but that clearly the old must remain in force until
            the new one has been promulgated. Also a petition of the Catholic
            clergy brought to Berlin by the bishop himself, which laid claim
            to this unlimited dominion over all Catholic educational and
            benevolent institutions, failed of its purpose. The clergy
            therefore wrought for <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page310">[pg
            310]</span><a name="Pg310" id="Pg310" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            this all the more zealously by fanaticizing the Catholic people
            in favour of French and against German interests. On the epidemic
            about the appearance of the mother of God called forth in this
            way, see <a href="#Section_188_Para_7" class="tei tei-ref">§ 188,
            7</a>. In 1874 the government found itself obliged to close the
            so-called <span class="tei tei-q">“little seminaries,”</span> or
            boys' colleges, on account of their fostering sentiments hostile
            to the empire. Yet in 1880 the newly appointed imperial governor,
            Field-marshal von Manteuffel (died 1885), at the request of the
            States-Committee, allowed Bishop Räss of Strassburg to reopen the
            seminary at Zillisheim, with the proviso that his teachers should
            be approved by the government, and that instruction in the German
            language should be introduced. Manteuffel has endeavoured since,
            by yielding favours to the France-loving Alsatians and
            Lorrainers, and to their ultramontane clergy, to win them over to
            the idea of the German empire, even to the evident sacrifice of
            the interests of resident Germans and of the Protestant church.
            But such fondling has wrought the very opposite result to that
            intended.</p>

            had himself repeatedly expressed his satisfaction at the conduct

            the bottom out of the Danaid's vessel of ultramontane forbearance
            and endurance. This day, 18th January, 1871, had as its result
            the overthrow of the temporal power of the papacy as well the
            establishment of a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page311">[pg
            311]</span><a name="Pg311" id="Pg311" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            new and hereditary German empire under the Protestant dynasty of
            the Prussian Hohenzollerns. German ultramontanism felt itself all
            the more under obligation to demand from the new emperor as the
            first expiation for such uncanonical usurpation, the
            reinstatement of the pope in his lost temporal power. But when he
            did not respond to this demand, the ultramontane party, by means
            of the press favourable to its claims, formally declared war
            against the German empire and its governments, and applied itself
            systematically to the mobilization of its entire forces. But the
            empire and its governments, with Prussia in the van, with
            unceasing determination, supported by the majority of the States'
            representatives, during the years 1871-1875 proceeded against the
            ultramontanes by legislative measures. The execution of these by
            the police and the courts of law, owing to the stubborn refusal
            to obey on the part of the higher and lower clergy, led to the
            formation of an opposition, commonly designated after a phrase of
            the Prussian deputy, Professor Virchow, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“<span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Kulturkampf</span></span>,”</span> which was
            in some degree modified first in 1887. The imperial chancellor,
            Prince Bismarck, uttered at the outset the confident,
            self-assertive statement, <span class="tei tei-q">“We go not to
            Canossa,”</span>—and even in 1880, when it seemed as if a certain
            measure of submission was coming from the side of the papacy, and
            the Prussian government also showed itself prepared to make
            important concessions, he declared, <span class="tei tei-q">“We
            shall not buy peace with Canossa medals; such are not minted in
            Germany.”</span> Since 1880, however, the Prussian government
            with increasing compliance from year to year set aside and
            modified the most oppressive enactments of the May laws, so as
            actually to redress distresses and inconveniences occasioned by
            clerical opposition to these laws, without being able thereby to
            obtain any important concession on the part of the papal curia,
            until at last in 1887, after the government had carried
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page312">[pg 312]</span><a name=
            "Pg312" id="Pg312" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> concession to the
            utmost limit, the pope put his seal to definitive terms of peace
            by admitting the right of giving information on the part of the
            bishops regarding appointments to vacant pastorates, as well as
            the right of protest on the part of the government against those
            thus nominated.</p>

            Ultramontanism.</span></em>—Even in the revolution year, 1848,
            German ultramontanism, in order to obtain what it called the
            freedom of the church, had zealously seconded many of the efforts
            of democratic radicalism. Nevertheless, in the years of reaction
            that followed, it succeeded in catching most of the influential
            statesmen on the limed twig of the assurance that the episcopal
            hierarchy, with its unlimited sway over the clergy and through
            them over the feelings of the people, constituted the only
            certain and dependable bulwark against the revolutionary
            movements of the age, and this idea prevailed down to 1860, and
            in Prussia down to 1871. But the overthrow of the concordat in
            Baden, Württemberg and Darmstadt by the states of the realm after
            a hard conflict, the humiliation of Austria in 1866, and the
            growth in so threatening a manner since of the still heretical
            Prussia, produced in the whole German episcopate a terrible
            apprehension that its hitherto untouched supremacy in the state
            would be at an end, and in order to ward off this danger it was
            driven into agitations and demonstrations partly secret and
            partly open. On 8th October, 1868, the papal nuncio in Munich,
            Monsignor Meglia, uttered his inmost conviction regarding the
            Württemberg resident thus: <span class="tei tei-q">“Only in
            America, England, and Belgium does the Catholic church receive
            its rights; elsewhere nothing can help us but the
            revolution.”</span> And on 22nd April, 1869, Bishop Senestray of
            Regensburg declared plainly in a speech delivered at Schwandorff:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“If kings will no longer be of God's
            grace, I shall be the first to overthrow the throne.... Only a
            war or revolution can help us in the end.”</span> And war at last
            came, but it helped only their opponents. Although at its
            outbreak in 1870 the ultramontane party in South Germany,
            especially in Bavaria, for the most part with unexampled
            insolence expressed their sympathy with France, and after the
            brilliant and victorious close of the war did everything to
            prevent the attachment of Bavaria to the new German empire, their
            North German brethren, accustomed to the boundless compliance of
            the Prussian government, indulged the hope of prosecuting their
            own ends all the more successfully under the new regime. Even in
            November, 1870, Archbishop Ledochowski of Posen visited the
            victorious king of Prussia at Versailles, in order to interest
            him personally in the restoration of the Papal States. In
            February, 1871, in the same place, fifty-six Catholic deputies of
            the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page313">[pg 313]</span><a name=
            "Pg313" id="Pg313" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Prussian
            parliament presented to the king, who had meanwhile been
            proclaimed Emperor of Germany, a formal petition for the
            restoration of the temporal power of the pope, and soon
            afterwards a deputation of distinguished laymen waited upon him
            <span class="tei tei-q">“in name of all the Catholics of
            Germany,”</span> with an address directed to the same end. The
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Bavarian Fatherland</span></em> (Dr. Sigl)
            indeed treated it with scorn as a <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“belly-crawling-deputation, which crawled before the
            magnanimous hero-emperor, beseeching him graciously to use said
            deputation as his spittoon.”</span> And the <span lang="de"
            class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Steckenberger Bote</span></span>, inspired
            by Dr. Ketteler, declared: <span class="tei tei-q">“We Catholics
            do not entreat it as a favour, but demand it as our right....
            Either you must restore the Catholic church to all its privileges
            or not one of all your existing governments will endure.”</span>
            At the same time as the insinuation was spread that the new
            German empire threatened the existence of the Catholic church in
            Germany, a powerful ultramontane election agitation in view of
            the next Reichstag was set on foot, out of which grew the party
            of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Centre,”</span> so called from
            sitting in the centre of the hall, with Von Ketteler, Windthorst,
            Mallinkrodt (died 1874), and the two Reichenspergers, as its most
            eloquent leaders. Even in the debate on the address in answer to
            the speech from the throne this party demanded intervention, at
            first indeed only diplomatic, in favour of the Papal States. In
            the discussion on the new imperial constitution A. Reichensperger
            sought to borrow from the abortive German landowners' bill of
            1848, condemned indeed as godless by the syllabus (<a href=
            "#Section_185_Para_2" class="tei tei-ref">§ 185, 2</a>),
            principles that might serve the turn of ultramontanism regarding
            the unrestricted liberty of the press, societies, meetings, and
            religion, with the most perfect independence of all religious
            communities of the State. Mallinkrodt insisted upon the need of
            enlarged privileges for the Catholic church owing to the great
            growth of the empire in Catholic territory and population. All
            these motions were rejected by the Reichstag, and the Prussian
            government answered them by abolishing in July, 1871, the
            Catholic department of the Ministry of Public Worship, which had
            existed since 1841 (<a href="#Section_193_Para_2" class=

            able to guard and save the Catholic church from the annihilating
            projects of Prussia. And in this way the Catholic people
            throughout all <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page314">[pg

            Germany were roused and incited by the Catholic press, as well as
            from the pulpit and confessional, in home and school, in Catholic
            monasteries and nunneries, in mechanics' clubs and peasants'
            unions, in casinos and assemblies of nobles. Bishop Ketteler
            founded expressly for purposes of such agitations the Mainz
            Catholic Union, in September, 1871, which by its itinerant
            meetings spread far and wide the flame of religious fanaticism;
            and a Bavarian priest, Lechner, preached from the pulpit that one
            does not know whether the German princes are by God's or by the
            devil's grace.</p>

            "font-style: italic">Conflicts Occasioned by Protection of the
            Old Catholics, 1871-1872.</span></em>—That the Prussian
            government refused to assist the bishops in persecuting the Old
            Catholics, and even retained these in their positions after
            excommunication had been hurled against them, was regarded by
            those bishops as itself an act of persecution of the Catholic
            church. To this opinion they gave official expression, under
            solemn protest against all encroachments of the state upon the
            domain of Catholic faith and law, in a memorial addressed to the
            German emperor from Fulda, on September 7th, 1871, but were told
            firmly and decidedly to keep within their own boundaries. Even
            before this Bishop <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Krementz of Ermeland</span></em> had refused
            the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "la"><span style="font-style: italic">missio
            canonica</span></span> to Dr. Wollmann, teacher of religion at
            the Gymnasium of Braunsberg, on account of his refusing to
            acknowledge the dogma of infallibility, and had forbidden
            Catholic scholars to attend his instructions. The minister of
            public worship, Von Mühler, decided, because religious
            instruction was obligatory in the Prussian gymnasia, that all
            Catholic scholars must attend or be expelled from the
            institution. The Bavarian government followed a more correct
            course in a similar case that arose about the same time; for it
            recognised and protected the religious instructions of the
            anti-infallibilist priest, Renftle in Mering, as legitimate, but
            still allowed parents who objected to withhold their children
            from it. And in this way the new Prussian minister, Falk,
            corrected his predecessor's mistake. But all the more decidedly
            did the government proceed against Bishop Krementz, when he
            publicly proclaimed the excommunication uttered against Dr.
            Wollmann and Professor Michelis, which had been forbidden by
            Prussian civil law on account of the infringement of civil rights
            connected therewith according to canon law. As the bishop could
            not be brought to an explicit acknowledgment of his obligation to
            obey the laws of the land, the minister of public worship on
            October 1st, 1872, stripped him of his temporalities. But
            meanwhile a second conflict had broken out. The Catholic
            field-provost of the Prussian army and bishop <span lang="la"
            class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">in partibus</span></span>, Namszanowski, had
            under papal direction commanded the Catholic divisional chaplain,
            Lünnemann of Cologne, on pain of excommunication, to discontinue
            the military worship in the garrison chapel, <span class=

            military court, was jointly used by the Old Catholics, and so was
            desecrated. He was therefore brought before a court of
            discipline, suspended from his office in May, 1872, and finally,
            by royal ordinance in 1873, the office of field-provost was
            wholly abolished.</p>

            "font-style: italic">Struggles over Educational Questions,
            1872-1873.</span></em>—In the formerly Polish provinces of the
            Prussian kingdom the Polonization of resident Catholic Germans
            had recently assumed threatening proportions. The archbishop of
            Posen and Gnesen, Count <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Ledochowski</span></em>, whom the pope
            during the Vatican Council appointed primate of Poland, was the
            main centre of this agitation. In the Posen priest seminary he
            formed for himself, in a fanatically Polish clergy, the tools for
            carrying it out, and in the neighbouring Schrimm he founded a
            Jesuit establishment that managed the whole movement. Where
            previously Polish and German had been preached alternately,
            German was now banished, and in the public schools, the oversight
            of which, as throughout all Prussia, lay officially in the hands
            of the clergy, all means were used to discourage the study of the
            German language, and to stamp out the German national sentiment.
            But even in the two western provinces the Catholic public schools
            were made by the clerical school inspectors wholly subservient to
            the designs of ultramontanism. In order to stem such disorder the
            government, in February, 1872, sanctioned the <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">School Inspection
            Law</span></em> passed by the parliament, by which the right and
            duty of school inspection was transferred from the church to the
            state, so that for the sake of the state the clerical inspectors
            hostile to the government were set aside, and where necessary
            might be replaced by laymen. A pastoral letter of the Prussian
            bishops assembled at Fulda in April of that year complained
            bitterly of persecution of the church and unchristianizing of the
            schools, but advised the Catholic clergy under no circumstances
            voluntarily to resign school inspection where it was not taken
            from them. By a rescript of the minister of public worship in
            June, the exclusion of all members of spiritual orders and
            congregations from teaching in public schools was soon followed
            by the suppression of the Marian congregations in all schools,
            and it was enjoined in March, 1873, that in Polish districts,
            where other subjects had been taught in the higher educational
            institutions in the German language, this also would be
            obligatory in religious instruction. Ledochowski indeed directed
            all religious teachers in his diocese to use the Polish language
            after as they had done before, but the government suspended all
            teachers who followed his direction, and gave over the religious
            instruction to lay teachers. The archbishop now erected private
            schools for the religious instruction of gymnasial teachers, and
            the government forbad attendance at them.</p><span class=

            more and more decided measures against the ultramontanism that
            had become so rampant in its domains, on the other hand, its
            mobile band of warriors in cassock, dress coat, and blouse did
            not cease to labour, and the imperial government passed some
            drastic measures of defence applicable to the whole empire. At
            the instance of the Bavarian government, which could not defend
            itself from the violence of its <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“patriots,”</span> the Federal Council asked the
            Reichstag to add a new article to the penal code of the empire,
            threatening any misuse of the pulpit for political agitation with
            imprisonment for two years. The Bavarian minister of public
            worship, Lutz, undertook himself to support this bill before the
            Reichstag. <span class="tei tei-q">“For several decades,”</span>
            he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“the clergy in Germany have
            assumed a new character; they are become the simple reflection of
            Jesuitism.”</span> The Reichstag sanctioned the bill in December,
            1871. Far more deeply than this so-called <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Kanzelparagraph</span></em>, the operation
            of which the agitation of the clergy by a little circumspection
            could easily elude, did the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Jesuit Law</span></em>, published on July
            4th, 1872, cut into the flesh of German ultramontanism. Already
            in April of that year had a petition from Cologne demanding the
            expulsion of the Jesuits been presented to the Reichstag. Similar
            addresses flowed in from other places. The Centre party, on the
            other hand, organized a regular flood of petitions in favour of
            the Jesuits. The Reichstag referred both to the imperial
            chancellor, with the request to introduce a law against the
            movements of the Jesuits as dangerous to the State. The Federal
            Council complied with this request, and so the law was passed
            which ordained the removal of the Jesuits and related orders and
            congregations, the closing of their institutions within six
            months, and prohibited the formation of any other orders by their
            individual members, and the government authorised the banishment
            of foreign members and the interning of natives at appointed
            places. A later ordinance of the Federal Council declared the
            Redemptorists, Lazarists, Priests of the Holy Ghost, and the
            Society of the Heart of Jesus to be orders related to the Society
            of Jesus. Those affected by this law anticipated the threatened
            interning by voluntarily removing to Belgium, Holland, France,
            Turkey, and America.</p>

            restrict by law the despotic absolutism of the bishops in
            disciplinary and beneficiary matters, the Prussian government
            brought in other four ecclesiastical bills, which in spite of
            violent opposition on the part of the Centre and the Old
            Conservatives, were successively passed by both houses of
            parliament, and approved by the king on May 11th, <span class=

            Their most important provisions are: As a condition for admission
            to a spiritual office the state requires citizenship of the
            German empire, three years' study at a German university, and,
            besides an exit gymnasial examination preceding the university
            course, a state examination in general knowledge (in philosophy,
            history, and German literature), in addition to the theological
            examination. The episcopal boys' seminaries and colleges are
            abolished. The priest seminaries, if the minister of worship
            regards them as fit for the purpose, may take the place of the
            university course, but must be under regular state inspection.
            The candidates for spiritual offices, which must never be left
            vacant more than a year, are to be named to the chief president
            of the province, and he can for cogent reasons lodge a protest
            against them. Secession from the church is freely allowed, and
            releases from all personal obligations to pay ecclesiastical dues
            and perform ecclesiastical duties. Excommunication is
            permissible, but can be proclaimed only in the congregation
            concerned, and not publicly. The power of church discipline over
            the clergy can be exercised only by German superiors and in
            accordance with fixed processional procedure. Corporal punishment
            is not permissible, fines are allowed to a limited extent, and
            restraint by interning in so-called <span class=
            "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Demeriti</span></span> houses, but only at
            furthest of three months, and when the party concerned willingly
            consents. Church servants, whose remaining in office is
            incompatible with the public order, can be deposed by civil
            sentence. And as final court of appeal in all cases of complaint
            between ecclesiastical and civil authorities as well as within
            the ecclesiastical domain, a royal court of justice for
            ecclesiastical affairs is constituted, whose proceedings are open
            and its decision final.—But even the May Laws soon proved
            inadequate for checking the insolence of the bishops and the
            disorders among the Catholic population occasioned thereby. In
            December, 1873, therefore, by sovereign authority there was
            prescribed a new formula of the episcopal Oath of Allegiance,
            recognising more distinctly and decisively the duty of obedience
            to the laws of the state. Then next a bill was presented to the
            parliament, which had been kept in view in the original
            constitution, demanding obligatory civil marriage and abolition
            of compulsory baptism, as well as the conducting of civil
            registration by state officials. In February, 1874, it was passed
            into law. On the 20th and 21st <em class=

            1874</span></em>, two other bills brought in for extending the
            May Laws of the previous year, in consequence of which a bishop's
            see vacated by death, a judicial sentence, or any other cause,
            must be filled within the space of a year, and the chapter must
            elect within ten days an episcopal administrator, who has to be
            presented to the chief president, and to undertake an oath to
            obey the laws of the state. If the chapter does <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page318">[pg 318]</span><a name="Pg318" id=
            "Pg318" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> not fulfil these
            requirements, a lay commissioner will be appointed to administer
            the affairs of the diocese. During the episcopal vacancy, all
            vacant pastorates, as well as all not legally filled, can be at
            once validly supplied by the act of the patron, and, where no
            such right exists, by congregational election. Parochial
            property, on the illegal appointment of a pastor, is given over
            to be administered by a lay commissioner.—The empire also came to
            the help of the May Laws by an imperial enactment of May 4th,
            1874, sanctioned by the emperor, which empowers the competent
            state government to intern all church officers discharged from
            their office and not yielding submission thereto, as well as all
            punished on account of incompetence in their official duties,
            and, if this does not help, to condemn them to loss of their
            civil rights and to expulsion from the German federal
            territory.—Also in its next session the imperial house of
            representatives again gave legislative sanction to the

            for in January, 1875, it passed a bill presented by the Federal
            Council on the deposition on oath as to personal rank, and on
            divorce with obligatory civil marriage, which, going far beyond
            the Prussian civil law of the previous year, and especially
            ridding Bavaria of its strait-jacket canon marriage law enforced
            by the concordat, abolished the spiritual jurisdiction in favour
            of that of the civil courts, and gave it to the state to
            determine the qualifications for, as well as the hindrances to,
            divorce, without, however, touching the domain of conscience, or
            entrenching in any way upon the canon law and the demands of the
            church.</p>

            "font-style: italic">Opposition in the States to the Prussian May
            Laws.</span></em>—Bishop Martin of Paderborn had even beforehand
            refused obedience to the May Laws of 1873. After their
            promulgation, all the Prussian bishops collectively declared to
            the ministry that <span class="tei tei-q">“they were not in a
            position to carry out these laws,”</span> with the further
            statement that they could not comply even with those demands in
            them which in other states, by agreement with the pope, are
            acknowledged by the church, because they are administered in a
            one-sided way by the state in Prussia. On these lines also they
            proceeded to take action. First of all, the refractoriness of
            several of the seminaries drew down upon them the loss of
            endowment and of the right of representation; and in the next
            place, the refusal of the bishops to notify their appointment of
            clergymen led to their being frequently fined, while the church
            books and seals were taken away from clergymen so appointed, all
            the official acts performed by them were pronounced invalid in
            civil law, and those who performed them were subjected to fines.
            But here, too, again Bishop Martin, well skilled in church
            history (he had been previously professor of theology in Bonn),
            had beforehand in a pastoral instructed his clergy that
            <span class="tei tei-q">“since the days <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page319">[pg 319]</span><a name="Pg319" id="Pg319" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> of Diocletian there had not been seen so
            violent a persecution of the name of Jesus Christ.”</span> Soon
            after this Archbishop Ledochowski, in an official document
            addressed to the Chief President of Poland, compared the demand
            to give notification of clerical appointments with the demand of
            ancient Rome upon Christian soldiers to sacrifice to the heathen
            gods. And by order of the pope prayers were offered in all
            churches for the church so harshly and cruelly persecuted. And
            yet the whole <span class="tei tei-q">“persecution”</span> then
            consisted in nothing more than this, that a newly issued law of
            the state, under threat of fine in case of disobedience, demanded
            again of the bishops paid by the state what had been accepted for
            centuries as unobjectionable in the originally Catholic Bavaria,
            and also for a long while in France, Portugal, and other Romish
            countries, what all Prussian bishops down to 1850 (<a href=
            "#Section_193_Para_2" class="tei tei-ref">§ 193, 2</a>) had done
            without scruple, what the bishops of Paderborn and Münster even
            had never refused to do in the extra-Prussian portion of these
            dioceses (Oldenburg and Waldeck), as also the Prince-Bishop of
            Breslau, since the issuing of the similar Austrian May Laws
            (<a href="#Section_198_Para_4" class="tei tei-ref">§ 198, 4</a>)
            in the Austro-Silesian part of his diocese, what the episcopal
            courts of Württemberg and Baden had yielded to, although in
            almost all these states the demand referred to broke up the union
            with the papal curia. Yet before a year had passed the cases of
            punishment for these offences had so increased that the only very
            inadequate fines that could be exacted by the seizure of property
            had to be changed into equivalent sentences of imprisonment. The
            first prelate who suffered this fate was Archbishop Ledochowski,
            in February, 1874. Then followed in succession: Eberhard of
            Treves, Melchers of Cologne, Martin of Paderborn, and Brinkmann
            of Münster. The ecclesiastical court of justice expressly
            pronounced deposition against Ledochowski in April, 1874; against
            Martin in January, 1875, and against the Prince-Bishop Förster of
            Breslau in October, 1875, who alone had dared to proclaim in his
            diocese the encyclical <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
            xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Quod
            nunquam</span></span> (Par. 7). But the latter had even
            beforehand withdrawn the diocesan property to the value of
            900,000 marks to his episcopal castle, Johannisberg, in
            Austro-Silesia, where with a truly princely income from Austrian
            funds he could easily get over the loss of the Prussian part of
            his revenues. Martin, who had been interned at Wesel, fled in
            August, 1875, under cloud of night, to Holland, from whence he
            transferred his agitations into Belgium, and finally to London
            (died 1879). Ledochowski found a residence in the Vatican.
            Brinkmann was deposed in March, and Melchers in June, 1876, after
            both had beforehand proved their enjoyment of martyrdom by
            escaping to Holland. Eberhard of Treves anticipated his
            deposition from office by his death in May, 1876. Blum of Limburg
            was deposed in June, 1877, and Beckmann <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page320">[pg 320]</span><a name="Pg320" id="Pg320" class=

            parliament and German Reichstag the Centre party, supported by
            Guelphs, Poles, and the Social Democrats, had meanwhile with
            anger, scorn, and vituperation, with and without wit, fought not
            only against all ecclesiastical, but also against all other
            legislative proposals, whose acceptance was specially desired by
            the government. And all the representatives of the ultramontane
            press within and without Europe vied with one another in violent
            denunciation of the ecclesiastical laws, and in unmeasured abuse
            of the emperor and the empire. But almost without exception the
            Roman Catholic officials in Prussia, as well as the Protestants
            and Old Catholics, carried out <span class="tei tei-q">“the
            Diocletian persecution of Christians”</span> in the judicial and
            police measures introduced by the church laws. A number of
            Catholic notables of the eastern provinces of their own accord,
            in a dutiful address to the emperor, expressly accepted the
            condemned laws, and won thereby the nickname of <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“State Catholics.”</span> The great mass of the
            Catholic people, high and low, remained unflinchingly faithful to
            the resisting clergy in, for the most part, only a passive
            opposition, although even, as the Berlin <span lang="de" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Germania</span></span> expressed it,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the Catholic rage at the Bismarckian
            ecclesiastical polity could condense itself into one Catholic
            head”</span> in a murderous attempt on the chancellor in quest of
            health at Kissingen, on July 13th, 1874. It was the cooper,
            Kullmann, who, fanaticised by exciting speeches and writings in
            the Catholic society of Salzwedel, sought to take vengeance, as
            he himself said, upon the chancellor for the May Laws and
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the insult offered to his party of the
            Centre.”</span>—In the further course of the Prussian <span lang=
            "de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Kulturkampf</span></span>, however, fostered
            by the aid of the confessional, the insinuating assiduity of the
            clerical press, and the all-prevailing influence of the
            thoroughly disciplined Catholic clergy over the popish masses,
            the Centre grew in number and importance at the elections from
            session to session, so that from the beginning of 1880, by the
            unhappy division of the other parties in the Reichstag as well as
            Chamber, it united sometimes with the Conservatives, sometimes
            and most frequently with the Progressionists and Democrats
            renouncing the <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "de"><span style="font-style: italic">Kulturkampf</span></span>,
            and was supported on all questions by Poles, Danes, Guelphs, and
            Alsatian-Lorrainers, as clerical interest and ultramontane
            tactics required, in accordance with the plan of campaign of the
            commander-in-chief, especially of the quondam Hanoverian
            minister, Windthorst, dominated far more by Guelphic than by
            ultramontane tendencies. The Centre was thus able to turn the
            scale, until, at least in the Reichstag, after the dissolution
            and new election of 1887, its dominatory power was broken by the
            closer combination of the conservative and national liberal
            parties.</p>

            "Pg321" id="Pg321" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the new emperor in
            1871, trusting, as he wrote, that his efforts directed to the
            common weal <span class="tei tei-q">“might bring blessing not
            only to Germany, but also to all Europe, and might contribute not
            a little to the protection of the liberty and rights of the
            Catholic religion.”</span> And when first of all the Centre
            party, called forth by the election agitation of German
            ultramontanism, opened its politico-clerical campaign in the
            Reichstag, he expressed his disapproval of its proceedings upon
            Bismarck's complaining to the papal secretary Antonelli. Yet a
            deputation of the Centre sent to Rome succeeded in winning over
            both. In order to build a bridge for the securing an
            understanding with the curia, now that the conflict had grown in
            extent and bitterness, the imperial government in May, 1872,
            appointed the Bavarian Cardinal Prince Hohenlohe to the vacant
            post of ambassador to the Vatican. But the pope, with offensive
            recklessness, rejected the well-meant proposal, and forbade the
            cardinal to accept the imperial appointment. From that time he
            gave free and public expression on every occasion to his
            senseless bitterness against the German empire and its
            government. In an address to the German Reading Society at Rome
            in July, 1872, he allowed himself to use the most violent
            expressions against the German chancellor, and closed with the
            prophetic threatening: <span class="tei tei-q">“Who knows but the
            little stone shall soon loose itself from the mountain (Dan. ii.
            34), which shall break in pieces the foot of the
            colossus?”</span> But even this diatribe was cast in the shade by
            the Christmas allocution of that year, in which he was not
            ashamed to characterize the procedure of the German statesmen and
            their imperial sovereign as <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang=
            "la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">impudentia</span></span>.”</span> And after
            the publication of the first May Laws he addressed a letter to
            the emperor, in which, founding upon the fact that even the
            emperor like all baptized persons belonged to him, the pope, he
            cast in his teeth that <span class="tei tei-q">“all the measures
            of his government for some time aimed more and more at the
            annihilation of Catholicism,”</span> and added the threatening
            announcement that <span class="tei tei-q">“these measures against
            the religion of Jesus Christ can have no other result than the
            overthrow of his own throne.”</span> The emperor in his answer
            made expressly prominent his divinely appointed call as well as
            his own evangelical standpoint, and with becoming dignity and
            earnestness decidedly repudiated the unmeasured assumptions of
            the papacy, and published both letters. In the same style of
            immoderate pretension the pope again, in November, 1875, in one
            encyclical after another, gave vent to his anger against emperor
            and empire, especially its military institutions. In place of the
            deposed and at that time imprisoned archbishop, Ledochowski, he
            appointed in 1874 a native apostolic legate, who was at last
            ascertained to be the Canon Kurowski, when he was in October,
            1875, condemned to two years' <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Encyclical Quod
            nunquam, of 5th February, 1875</span></em>, addressed to the
            Prussian episcopate, in which he characterized the Prussian May
            Laws as <span class="tei tei-q">“not given to free citizens to
            demand a reasonable obedience, but as laid upon slaves, in order
            to force obedience by fears of violence,”</span> and,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“in order to fulfil the duties of his
            office,”</span> declared quite openly to all whom it concerns and
            to the Catholics throughout the world: <span class=

            the sin of assuming spiritual office without a divine call, falls

            great excommunication. On the other hand he rewarded, in March,
            1875, Archbishop Ledochowski, then still in prison, but
            afterwards, in February, 1876, settled in Rome, for his sturdy
            resistance of those laws, with a cardinal's hat, and to the not
            less persistent Prince-Bishop Förster of Breslau he presented on
            his jubilee as priest the archiepiscopal pall. In the next
            Christmas allocution he romanced about a second Nero, who, while
            in one place with a lyre in his hand he enchanted the world by
            lying words, in other places appeared with iron in his hand, and,
            if he did not make the streets run with blood, he fills the
            prisons, sends multitudes into exile, seizes upon and with
            violence assumes all authority to himself. Also to the German
            pilgrims who went in May, 1877, to his episcopal jubilee at Rome,
            he had still much that was terrible to tell about this
            <span class="tei tei-q">“modern Attila,”</span> leaving it
            uncertain whether he intended Prince Bismarck or the mild, pious

            existing laws of the state. II. A law of May 31st, 1875, ordering
            the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            Congregations</span></em> within eight months, the minister of
            public worship, however, being authorized to extend this truce to
            four years in the case of institutions devoted to <span class=

            while those which were exclusively hospital and nursing societies
            were allowed to remain, but were subject to state inspection and
            might at any time be suppressed by royal order. III. A law of
            June 12th, 1875, declaring the formal <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Abrogation of the
            Fifteenth, Sixteenth, and Eighteenth Articles of the
            Constitution</span></em> (<a href="#Section_193_Para_2" class=
            "tei tei-ref">§ 193, 2</a>). And finally in addition there came
            the enforcement during this session of the Chamber of laws
            previously introduced on the rights of the Old Catholics
            (<a href="#Section_190_Para_2" class="tei tei-ref">§ 190, 2</a>),
            and, on June 20th, 1875, on the administration of church property
            in Catholic parishes. The latter measures aimed at withdrawing
            the administration referred to from the autocratic absolutism of
            the clergy, and transferring it to a lay commission elected by
            the community itself, of which the parish priest was to be a
            member, but not the president. Although the Archbishop of Cologne
            in name of all the bishops before its issue had solemnly
            protested against this law, because by it <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“essential and inalienable rights of the Catholic
            church were lost,”</span> and although the recognition of it
            actually involved recognition of the May Laws and the
            ecclesiastical court of justice, yet all the bishops declared
            themselves ready to co-operate in carrying out the arrangements
            for surrendering the church property to the administration of a
            civil commission. They thus indeed secured thoroughly
            ultramontane elections, but at the same time put themselves into
            a position of self-contradiction, and admitted that the one
            ground of their opposition to the May Laws, that they were
            one-sidedly wrought by the state, was null and void.</p>

            his accession to the Emperor William, and expressed his regret at
            finding that the good relations did not continue which formerly
            existed between Prussia and the holy see. The Emperor's answer
            expressed the hope that by the aid of his Holiness the Prussian
            bishops might be induced to obey the laws of the land, as the
            people under their pastoral care actually did; and afterwards
            while in consequence of the attempt on his life of June 2nd,
            1873, he lay upon a sickbed, the crown prince on June 10th
            answered other papal communications by saying, that no Prussian
            monarch could entertain the wish to change the constitution and
            laws of his country in accordance with the ideas of the Romish
            church; but that, even though a thorough understanding upon the
            radical controversy of a thousand years could not be reached, yet
            the endeavour to preserve a conciliatory disposition on both
            sides would also for Prussia open a way to peace which had never
            been closed in other states. Three weeks later the Munich nuntio
            Masella was at Kissingen and conferred with the chancellor,
            Prince Bismarck, who was residing there, about the possibility of
            a basis of reconciliation. Subsequently negotiations were
            continued at <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page324">[pg
            324]</span><a name="Pg324" id="Pg324" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            Gastein, and then in Vienna with the there resident nuntio
            Jacobini, but were suspended owing to demands by the curia to
            which the state could not submit. Still the pope attempted
            indirectly to open the way for renewed consultation, for he
            issued a brief dated February 24th, 1880, to <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Archbishop Melchers of Cologne”</span> (deposed by
            the royal court of justice), in which he declared his readiness
            to allow to the respective government boards notification of new
            elected priests before their canonical institution. Thereupon a
            communication was sent to Cardinal Jacobini that the state
            ministry had resolved, so soon as the pope had actually
            implemented this declaration of his readiness, to make every
            effort to obtain from the state representatives authority to set
            aside or modify those enactments of the May Laws which were
            regarded by the Romish church as harsh. But the pope received
            this compromise of the government very ungraciously and showed
            his dissatisfaction by withdrawing his concession, which besides
            referred only to the unremovable priests, therefore not to
            <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=

            the part of the papal curia, the government, at the instance of
            the minister of public worship, Von Puttkamer (<a href=
            "#Section_193_Para_6" class="tei tei-ref">§ 193, 6</a>), resolved
            in May, 1880, to introduce a bill which gave a wide discretionary
            power for moderating the unhappy state of matters that had
            prevailed since the passing of the May Laws, throughout Catholic
            districts, where 601 pastorates stood wholly vacant and 584
            partly so, and nine bishoprics, some by death and others by
            deposition. Although the need of peace was readily admitted on
            both sides, the Liberals opposed these <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Canossa proposals”</span> as far too great; the
            Centre, Poles, and Guelphs as far too small. Yet it obtained at
            last in a form considerably modified, through a compromise of the
            conservatives with a great part of the national liberals the
            consent of both chambers. This law, sanctioned on July 14th,
            1880, embraced these provisions: 1. The royal court shall no
            longer depose from office any church officers, but simply
            pronounce incapable of administering the office; 2-4. The
            ministry of the state is authorized to give the episcopal
            administrator charged by the church with the interim
            administration of a vacant bishopric a dispensation from the
            taking of the prescribed oath; further, an administration by
            commission of ecclesiastical property may be revoked as well as
            appointed; also state endowments that had been withdrawn are to
            be restored for the benefit of the whole extent of the diocese;
            5. Spiritual official acts of a duly appointed clergyman by way
            merely of assistance <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page325">[pg
            325]</span><a name="Pg325" id="Pg325" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            in another vacant parish are to be allowed; 6. The minister of
            the interior and of public worship are empowered to approve of
            the erection of new institutions of religious societies which are
            devoted wholly to the care of the sick, as to allow revocably to
            them the care and nurture of children not yet of school age; and
            more recently added were 7, the particular, according to which
            Articles 2, 3, and 4 cease to operate after January 1st, 1882.
            The government was particularly careful to carry out the
            provisions temporarily recognised in Article 3, for the
            restoration of orderly episcopal administration by regularly
            elected episcopal administrators in bishoprics made vacant by
            death. Fulda, which was longest vacant, from October, 1873, had
            to be left out of account, since in that case there was only one
            member of the chapter left and so a canonical election was
            impossible. But without difficulty in March, 1881, the
            Vicar-General Dr. Höting for Osnabrück and Canon Drobe for
            Paderborn, without taking the oath of allegiance, succeeded in
            obtaining independent administration of the property as well as
            the restoration of state pay for the entire dioceses, though they
            did not give the notification required by the May Laws for the
            interim administration. In October, 1881, the deposed Prince
            Bishop Förster of Breslau died, and the suffragan bishop, Gleich,
            elected by the chapter, undertook with consent of the government
            the office of episcopal administrator.—Meanwhile the pope, by a
            hearty letter of congratulation to the emperor on his birthday,
            March 22nd, had given new life to the suspended peace
            negotiations. And now also, when the respective chapters
            transferred their right of election to the pope, the orderly
            appointments of the Canon Dr. Korum of Metz, a pupil of the
            Jesuit faculty of Innspruck, very warmly recommended by Von
            Manteuffel, governor of Alsace and Lorraine, to the episcopal see
            of Treves, in August, 1881, of Vicar-General Kopp of Hildesheim
            to Fulda in December, 1881, of the episcopal administrators
            Höting and Drobe, in March and May, 1882, respectively to
            Osnabrück and Paderborn, were duly carried into effect. For
            Breslau the chapter drew up a list of seven candidates, but the
            government pointed out the Berlin provost, Rob. Herzog, as a mild
            and conciliatory person. The chapter now laid its right of
            election in the hands of the pope, and in May, 1882, Herzog was
            raised to the dignity of prince-bishop. There now remained vacant
            only the sees of Cologne, Posen, Limburg and Münster, which had
            been emptied by the depositions of the civil courts.—Meanwhile,
            too, the negotiations carried on at the instance of the
            government by privy councillor Von Schlözer, with the curia at
            Rome for the restoration of the embassy to the Vatican had been
            brought to a close. The chamber voted for this purpose an annual
            sum of 90,000 marks, and Schlözer himself was appointed to the
            post in March, 1882.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page326">[pg

            "font-style: italic">Conciliatory Negotiations,
            1882-1884.</span></em>—With January 1st, 1882, the three
            enactments of the July law of 1880, which might be enforced at
            the discretion of the government, ceased to operate. Von Gossler,
            minister of public worship since June, 1881, on behalf of
            government, introduced a new bill into the Chamber on January
            16th, 1882, for their re-enactment and extension, which by a
            compromise between the Conservatives and the Centre, after
            various modifications secured a majority in both houses. This
            second revised law embraced the following points: 1. Renewal of
            the three above-named enactments till April 1st, 1884; 2.
            Restoration of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Bishop's
            Paragraph,”</span> lost in 1880, in this new form: If the king
            has pardoned a bishop set aside by the ecclesiastical court, he
            becomes again the bishop of his diocese recognised by the state;
            3. The setting aside of the examination in general knowledge
            (<span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "de"><span style="font-style: italic">Kulturexamen</span></span>)
            for those who bring a certificate of having passed the Gymnasium
            exit examination, or have attended with diligence lectures on
            philosophy, history and German literature during a three years'
            course at a German university, or at a Prussian seminary of equal
            rank, and have given proof of this by presenting evidence to the
            chief president; 4. The setting aside of the rights of the patron
            and congregation of themselves filling the vacant pastorates
            during a vacancy in the episcopal see. The new law obtained royal
            sanction on <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">May 31st, 1882</span></em>. But its two most
            important articles, 2 and 3, remained for a long time a dead
            letter, and even Article 1 was only carried out by the resumption
            of the state emoluments for the Hohenzollerns and the five newly
            instituted bishoprics (Par. 10), but not for the other seven. But
            the ill humour of the ultramontane Hotspurs was raised to the
            boiling point by the fate of the bill introduced by the Centre
            into the Reichstag to set aside the Expatriation Law of May 4th,
            1874, which seemed to the government indispensable on account of
            its applicability to the agitations against the empire of the
            Polish clergy. This bill, after violent debates, was carried on
            January 18th, 1882, by a two-thirds majority; but it was cast out
            by the Federal Council on June 6th, almost unanimously, only
            Bavaria and Reuss <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign"
            xml:lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">jüngere
            Linie</span></span> voting in its favour. This was the result
            mainly of the failure of all the attempts of Von Schlözer to
            render the government's concessions acceptable to the papal
            curia.—On the other hand, the government of its own accord
            brought in a third revision scheme in June, 1883, by which it
            sought to relieve as far as possible the troubles of the Catholic
            church. By adopting this law: (1) The obligation of notification
            on the part of the bishops and the right of the state to protest
            on the change of temporary assistants and substitutes into
            regular spiritual officers, were abolished; as also (2) the
            competence of the court for ecclesiastical affairs in appeals
            against the protest of the chief president, which now therefore,
            according to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page327">[pg
            327]</span><a name="Pg327" id="Pg327" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            the generally prevailing rule, are referred to the minister of
            worship, the whole ministry, the parliament, the king; (3) the
            immunity from punishment in the execution of their office
            guaranteed in Article 5 of the July law of 1880 (Par. 10) was
            extended to all spiritual offices whether vacant or not; (4) the
            ordaining of individual candidates in vacant dioceses by bishops
            recognised by the state was declared to be legal. In spite of
            repeated declarations of the curia that it could and would agree
            to the notification only after a previous sufficient guarantee of
            perfectly free training of the clergy and free administration of
            the spiritual office, the king while residing at the Castle of
            Mainau on Lake Constance, on July 11th, 1883, sanctioned the
            so-called Mainau Law that had passed both houses, and on the
            14th, the minister of public worship demanded that the Prussian
            bishops, without making notification, should fill up vacancies in
            pastorates by appointing assistants, and should name those
            candidates who were eligible for such appointment under the
            conditions of the May Law of the previous year (Par. 3). The pope
            at last, in September, 1883, allowed the dispensation required,
            but for that time only and without prejudice for the future. By
            the end of May, 1,884 applications had been made to the senior of
            the Prussian episcopate appointed to receive such, Marnitz of
            Kulm, by 1,443 clergymen, of whom the government rejected only
            178 who had studied at the Jesuit institutions of Rome, Louvain,
            and Innsbrück.—In December, 1883, Bishop Blum of Limburg, and in
            January, 1884, Brinkmann of Münster were restored by royal grace,
            and for both dioceses, as well as for Ermeland, Kulm and
            Hildesheim, and at last also on March 31st, shortly before the
            closing of the door, even for Cologne, in this case, however,
            revocably, the arrest of salaries ceased, so that only the two
            archiepiscopal sees of Cologne and Posen remained vacant, and
            only Posen continued bereft of its endowments. On the other hand
            the government allowed the three discretionary enactments that
            were in operation till April 1st, 1884, to lapse without
            providing for their renewal. Also the proposal for abolishing the
            Expatriation Law of November, 1884, introduced anew by the Centre
            and again adopted by the Reichstag by a great majority, was
            thrown out by the Federal Council; but in the beginning of
            December, on the opening of the new Reichstag, it was again
            brought in by the Centre and passed, but was left quite unnoticed
            by the Federal Council. The repeated motions of the Centre for
            payment of the bishops' salaries from the state exchequer, as
            well as for immunity to those who read mass and dispensed the
            sacraments, were again thrown out by the House of Deputies in
            April, 1885.</p>

            capacity he had to remain in Rome. He now declared himself
            willing to accept Ledochowski's resignation of the archbishopric
            if the Prussian government would allow a successor who would
            possess the confidence of the holy see as well as of the Polish
            inhabitants of the diocese. But of the three noble Polish
            chauvinists submitted by the Vatican the government could accept
            none. Since further no agreement could be reached on the question
            of the bishop's obligation to make notification and the state's
            right to protest, the negotiations were for a long time at a
            standstill, and were repeatedly on the point of being broken off.
            But from the middle of 1885, a conciliatory movement gained
            power, through the counsels of the more moderate party among the
            cardinals. Archbishop Melchers, who lived as an exile in
            Maestricht, was called to Rome, and as a reward for his
            assistance was made cardinal, and the pope consecrated as his
            successor in the archbishopric of Cologne, Bishop Krementz of
            Ermeland (Par. 2), who also was acknowledged by the Prussian
            government and introduced to Cologne on December 15th, 1885, with
            great pomp, with 20,000 torches and twenty bands of music. After
            a long list of candidates had been set aside by one side and the
            other, some here, some there, the pope at last fell from his
            demand for one of Polish nationality, and in March, 1886,
            appointed to the vacant see Julius Dinder, dean of Königsberg, a
            German by nation but speaking the Polish language.—Meanwhile at
            other points advance was made in the peaceful, yea, even
            friendly, relations between the pope and the Prussian government.
            The diplomatist Leo showed his admiring regard for the
            diplomatist Bismarck by sending him a valuable oil-painting of
            himself by a Münich master, and the latter astonished the world
            by making the pope umpire in a threatening conflict with Spain on
            the possession of the Caroline islands. His decision on the main
            question was indeed in favour of Spain, but not unimportant
            concessions were also made to Germany. The pope sent the prince
            two Latin poems as <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
            xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">pretium
            affectionis</span></span>, and conferred upon him, the first
            Protestant that had ever been so honoured, at the close of 1885
            or beginning of 1886, the highest papal order, the insignia of
            the Order of Christ, with brilliants, after the cardinal
            secretary of state Jacobini as president of the papal court of
            arbitration had been rewarded with the Prussian order of the
            Black Eagle, and the other members of the court with other high
            Prussian orders; and at the end of April, 1886, the German
            emperor sent the pope himself thanks for his mediation, with an
            artistic and costly Pectoral (§ 59, 7) worth 10,000 marks.—The
            government had, meanwhile, on February 15th, 1886, brought in a
            new proposal of revision of church polity, the fourth, and in
            order to secure the advice of a distinguished representative of
            the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page329">[pg 329]</span><a name=
            "Pg329" id="Pg329" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Prussian
            episcopate, called Bishop Kopp of Fulda to the House of Peers.
            But as his demands for concessions, suggested to him, not by the
            pope, but by the Centre, went far beyond what was proposed, they
            were for the most part decidedly opposed by the minister of
            worship and rejected by the house. The law confirmed by the king
            on May 24th, 1886, made the following changes: Complete abolition
            of the examination in general culture; freeing of the seminaries
            recognised by the minister as suitable for clerical training, as
            well as faculties established in universities, seminaries and
            gymnasia from any special state inspection (as laid down in the
            May Laws), and subjecting such to the common laws affecting all
            similar educational institutions. Removal of restrictions
            requiring ecclesiastical disciplinary procedure to be only before
            German ecclesiastical courts; Abolition of the Court for
            Ecclesiastical Affairs and transference of its functions partly
            to the ministry of worship, which now as court of appeal in
            matters of church discipline dealt only with those cases which
            entailed a loss or reduction of official income, partly to the
            Berlin supreme court, which has jurisdiction in case of a breach
            of the law of the state by a church officer as well as in case of
            a refusal to fulfil the oath of obedience; The discretionary
            enactments of the government of 1880 (Par. 10) are again enforced
            and the modifications of these in Article 6 of that law are
            extended to all other institutions engaged on the home
            propaganda; All reading of private masses and dispensing of
            sacraments are no longer subjected to the infliction of
            penalties.—Some weeks before royal sanction was given to this
            law, Cardinal Jacobini had, at the instance of the pope,
            expressed his profound satisfaction with the success of the
            advice in the House of Peers, as also particularly at the
            prospect of other concessions promised by the government. In an
            official communication to the president of the House of Deputies,
            he proposed the addition that the notification of new
            appointments to vacant pastorates should begin from that date. In
            August there followed, on the part of the government, the
            hitherto refused dispensation for those trained by the Jesuits in
            Rome and Innsbrück, and in November, with consent of the minister
            of public worship, the re-opening of the episcopal seminaries at
            Fulda and Treves.</p>

            1887.</span></em>—In February, 1887, the state journal published
            a new form of oath for the bishops, sanctioned by royal
            ordinance, in which the obligation hitherto enforced <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“to conscientiously observe the laws of the
            state,”</span> was omitted, and the asseveration added,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“that I have not, by the oath, taken to
            his Holiness the pope and the church, undertaken any obligation
            which can be in conflict with the oath of fidelity as a subject
            of his Royal Majesty.”</span>—The promised fifth revision,
            meanwhile accepted by the pope in its several particulars and
            acknowledged by him as sufficient basis for a <span class=

            "Pg330" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> definitive peace, was on
            February 13th, 1887, contrary to precedent, first laid before the
            House of Peers. Bishop Kopp proposed a great number of changes
            and additions, of which several of a very important nature were
            accepted. The most important provisions of this law, which was
            passed on <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">April 29th, 1887</span></em>, are the
            following: The obligation on bishops to make notification applies
            only to the conferring of a spiritual office for life, and the
            right of protest by the state must rely upon a basis named and
            belonging to the civil domain; All state compulsion to lifelong
            reinstatement in a vacant office is unlawful; The previously
            insured immunity for reading mass and dispensing the sacraments
            is now applied to members of all spiritual orders again allowed
            in the kingdom; The duty of ecclesiastical superiors to
            communicate disciplinary decisions to the Chief President is
            given up. Those orders and congregations which devote themselves
            to aiding in pastoral work, the administering of Christian
            benevolence, and, on Bishop Kopp's motion, those which engage in
            educational work in girl's high schools and similar institutions,
            as well as those which lead a private life, are to be allowed and
            are to be also restored to the enjoyment of their original
            possessions; The training of missionaries for foreign work and
            the erection of institutions for this purpose are to be permitted
            to the privileged orders and congregations.—Bishop Kopp, and also
            the pope, with lively gratitude, accepted these ordinances as
            making the reconciliation an accomplished fact; but they also
            expressed the hope that the success of this peaceful arrangement
            will be such as shall lead to further important concessions to
            the rightful claims of the Catholic church. After this conclusive
            revision, besides the extremely contracted obligation of
            notification by the bishops and the almost completely
            insignificant right of civil protest, there remain of the
            <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "de"><span style="font-style: italic">Kulturkampf</span></span>
            laws only: the <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Kanzelparagraph</span></span>, the Jesuit
            and the exile enactments (all of them imperial and not Prussian
            laws), and the abrogation of the three articles of the Prussian
            constitution (Par. 8). Insignificant as the concessions of the
            papal curia may seem in comparison to the almost complete
            surrender of the Prussian government, it can hardly be said that
            Bismarck has been untrue to his promise not to go to Canossa.
            With him the main thing ever was to restore within the German
            empire the peace that was threatened by thunderclouds gathering
            from day to day in the political horizon in east and west, and
            thus, as also by nurturing and developing the military forces, to
            set aside the danger of war from without. But for this end, the
            sovereignty of the Centre, which hampered him on every side,
            allying itself with all elements in the Chamber and Reichstag
            hostile to the government and the empire, must be broken. But
            this was possible only if he succeeded in breaking up the
            unhallowed artificial amalgamation of Catholic church interests
            for which the Centre contended <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page331">[pg 331]</span><a name="Pg331" id="Pg331" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> with the political tendencies of the party
            hostile to the empire by recognising those interests in a manner
            satisfactory to the pope and to all right-minded loyal German
            Catholics, and so estranging them from the political schemes of
            the leader of the Centre. This indeed would have scarcely been
            possible with Pius IX., but with the much clearer and sharper Leo
            XIII. there was hope of success. And the statesmanlike insight
            and self-denial of the prince succeeded, though at first only in
            a limited measure, and this was a much more important gain for
            the state than the papal concessions of episcopal notification
            and the state's right of protest.—When in the beginning of 1887,
            at the same time that the fear was greatest of a war with France
            and Russia, the renewal and enlargement of the military budget,
            hitherto for seven years, was necessary, and its refusal by the
            Centre and its adherents was regarded as certain, Bismarck
            prevailed on the pope to intervene in his favour. The pope did it
            in a confidential communication to the president of the Centre,
            in which he urged acceptance of the septennial act in the
            Reichstag for the security of the Fatherland and the conserving
            of peace on the continent, expressly referring to the friendly
            and promising attitude of the imperial government to the papacy
            and the Catholic church. But the president kept the communication
            secret from the members of his party, and they continued
            strenuously and unanimously opposed to the Septennate. The
            Reichstag was consequently dissolved. The pope now published this
            correspondence with the leaders of the Centre, thirty-seven
            Rhenish nobles separated from the party, and the new elections to
            the Reichstag were mainly favourable to the government. Although
            the Deputy Windthorst as chief leader of the Prussian <span lang=
            "la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Ecclesia militans</span></span> had on every
            occasion protested his and his party's profoundest reverence for
            and conditional submission to every expression of the papal will,
            and shortly before (<a href="#Section_186_Para_3" class=

            "tei tei-q">“Lord of the whole world,”</span> he opposed himself,
            as he had done on the Septennate question, on the fifth revision
            of the ecclesiastical laws, to the will of the infallible pope by
            publishing a memorial proving the absolute impossibility of
            accepting this proposed law, which, however, this time also he
            failed to carry out.</p>

            energy in the struggle against ultramontanism (Par. 4) soon

            were forbidden to attend the Jesuit German College at Rome (§

            and exercised it more freely (<a href="#Section_196_Para_6"
            class="tei tei-ref">§ 196, 6</a>) than Prussia laid claim

            all the more easily maintain ecclesiastical peace, since its

            previously broken out (<a href="#Section_196_Para_2" class=
            "tei tei-ref">§ 196, 2</a>) was continued all the more keenly. In
            1873 public teaching, holding of missions and assisting in
            pastoral work, had been refused to all religious orders and
            fraternities. But the main blow, followed by the comprehensive
            church legislation of February 19th, 1874, which closed all boys'
            seminaries and episcopal institutions, allowed none to hold a
            clerical office or discharge any ecclesiastical function without
            a three years' course at a German university and a state
            examination in general culture (<a href="#Section_196_Para_2"
            class="tei tei-ref">§ 196, 2</a>), strictly forbad all
            influencing of public elections by the clergy, and made
            deposition follow the second conviction of a church officer. The
            expedient hitherto resorted to of appointing mere deputy priests
            so as to avoid the examination, was consequently frustrated. The
            rapid increase of vacant pastorates, after five years'
            opposition, at last moved the episcopal curia to sue for peace at
            the hands of the government, and when the latter showed an
            exceedingly conciliatory spirit, the curia with consent of the
            pope in February, 1880, withdrew its prohibition of the request
            for dispensation from the state examination, and the government
            now on its part with the Chambers passed a law, by which the
            obligation to undergo this examination was abolished, and the
            certificate of the exit examination, three years' attendance at a
            German university, and diligent attention to at least three
            courses of the philosophical faculty, was held as sufficient
            evidence of general culture. The Baden <span lang="de" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Kulturkampf</span></span> seems to have been
            definitely concluded by the election and recognition of Dr. Orbin
            to the see of Freiburg, vacant for fourteen years, when he
            without scruple took the oath of allegiance. This, however, did
            not check, far less put an end to the tumults of the fanatical
            ultramontane Irredenta.</p>

            the example of Prussia and Baden in excluding all spiritual
            orders from teaching in public schools, and on April 23rd, 1875,
            issued five ecclesiastical laws which were directed to restoring
            under penal sanctions the state of the law, which before 1850
            (<a href="#Section_196_Para_4" class="tei tei-ref">§ 196, 4</a>)
            had been unquestioned. Essentially in harmony with the Prussian
            May Laws of 1873 and 1874, they go beyond these in several
            particulars. All clergymen receiving appointments, <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>,
            must have gone through a full university course; all religious
            orders and congregations were to be allowed to die out; public
            roads and squares could be used for ecclesiastical festivals only
            by permission of the government to be renewed on each occasion.
            The <span class="tei tei-q">“contentious”</span> Bishop Ketteler
            of Mainz, who stirred up the fire to the utmost with the Prussian
            brand, and had kindled also a similar flame in Hesse over the
            proposal of this law, held still that to view <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page333">[pg 333]</span><a name="Pg333" id=
            "Pg333" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> martyrdom at a distance was
            the better part, and carefully avoided any overt act of
            disobedience. But he immediately refused to co-operate in
            restoring the Catholic theological faculty at Giessen, and the
            government consequently abandoned the idea. The Mainz see after
            Ketteler's death in 1877 remained long vacant, as the government
            felt obliged to reject the electoral list submitted by the
            chapter. A candidate satisfactory to the Vatican and the
            government was only found in May, 1886, in the person of Dr.
            Haffner, a member of the chapter. After Prussia had concluded its
            definitive peace with Rome, the Hessian government, in May, 1887,
            laid before the house of representatives a revision of
            ecclesiastical legislation of 1875, like that of Prussia, only
            not going so far, for which meanwhile the approval of the papal
            curia had been obtained. It agrees to the erection of a Catholic
            clerical seminary, and Catholic students' residences in this
            seminary and in the state-gymnasia; erection of independent boys'
            institutions preparatory to the seminary for priests is, however,
            still refused; the existing duty of bishops to make notification,
            and the right of the state to protest in regard to appointments
            to vacant pastorates are also retained. There is no word of
            rehabilitating religious orders and congregations, nor of any
            limitation of the law about the exercise of ecclesiastical
            punishment and means of discipline.—(5) Last of all among the

            of the contention of the talented heir to the throne, Prince
            George, that the power of the state in relation to the Catholic
            church could only be determined by a concordat with the Roman
            curia.</p>

            presidency of the German Federal Council. The remnants of the
            Josephine ecclesiastical constitution were gradually set aside
            and Catholicism firmly established as the state religion; yet the
            government asserted its independence against all hierarchical
            claims, and granted, though only in a very limited degree,
            toleration to Protestantism. The revolution year 1848 removed

            these limits, but the period of reaction that followed gave, by
            means of a concordat concluded with the curia in 1855, to the
            ultramontane hierarchy of the country an unprecedented power in
            almost all departments of civil life, and prejudicial also to the
            interests of the Protestant church. After the disastrous issue of
            the Italian war in 1859, and still more that of the German war in
            1866, the government was obliged to make an honest effort to
            introduce and develop liberal institutions. And after an imperial
            patent of 1861 had secured religious liberty,
            self-administration, and equal rights to the Protestant church,
            the constitutional legislation of 1868 freed Catholic as well as
            Protestant civil, educational, and ecclesiastical matters from
            the provisions of the concordat that most seriously threatened
            them, and by the declaration of papal infallibility in 1870 the
            government felt justified in regarding the entire concordat as
            antiquated and declaring it abolished. In its place a Catholic
            church act was passed by the state in 1874. But the <span lang=

            evangelical truth had spread among several families by means of
            Protestant books and Bibles. When the Catholic clergy from 1826
            had pushed to its utmost the clerical guardianship by means of
            auricular confession, an opposition arose which soon from the
            refusal to confess passed on to the rejection of saint worship,
            masses for the dead, purgatory, indulgences, etc., and ended in
            the formal secession of many to the evangelical church in 1830,
            with a reference to the Josephine edict of toleration. The
            emperor Francis I., to whom on the occasion of his visit to
            Innsbrück in 1832 they presented their petition, promised them
            toleration. But the Tyrolese nobles protested, and the official
            decision, given at last in 1834, ordered removal to Transylvania
            or return to the Catholic church. The petitioners now applied, as

            "font-style: italic">The Concordat.</span></em>—After the
            revolution year 1848, the government were far more yielding
            toward the claims of the hierarchy than under the old Metternich
            <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "fr"><span style="font-style: italic">régime</span></span>. In
            April, 1850, an imperial patent relieved the papal and episcopal
            decrees of the necessity of imperial approval, and on August
            18th, 1855, a concordat with the pope was agreed to, by which
            unprecedented power and independence was granted to the hierarchy
            in Austria for all time to come. The first article secured to the
            Roman Catholic religion throughout the empire all rights and
            privileges which they claimed by divine institution and the canon
            law. The others gave to the bishops the right of unrestricted
            correspondence with Rome, declared that no papal ordinance
            required any longer the royal <span lang="la" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">placet</span></span>, that prelates are
            unfettered in the discharge of their hierarchical obligations,
            that religious instruction in all schools is under their
            supervision, that no one can teach religion or theology without
            their approval, that in catholic schools there can be only
            catholic teachers, that they have the right of forbidding all
            books which may be injurious to the faithful, that all cases of
            ecclesiastical law, especially marriage matters, belong to their
            jurisdiction, yet the apostolic see grants that purely secular
            law matters of the clergy are to be decided before a civil
            tribunal, and the emperor's right of nomination to vacant
            episcopal sees is to continue, etc. The inferior clergy, who were
            now without legal protection against the prelates, only
            reluctantly bowed their necks to this hard yoke; the liberal
            Catholic laity murmured, sneered, and raged, and the native press
            incessantly urged a revision of the concordat, the necessity of
            which became ever more apparent from concessions made meanwhile
            willingly or grudgingly to the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Non-Catholics.”</span> But only after Austria, by
            the issue of the German war of 1866, was restricted to her own
            domain, and finally freed from the drag of its ultramontane
            Italian interests, found herself obliged to make every effort to
            reconcile the opposing parties within her own territories, could
            these views prove successful. But since the government
            nevertheless held firmly by the principle that the concordat, as
            a state contract regularly concluded between two sovereigns,
            could be changed only by mutual consent, the liberal majority of
            the house of deputies resolved to make it as harmless as possible
            by means of domestic legislation, and on June 11th, 1867, the
            deputy Herbst moved the appointment of a committee for drawing up
            three bills for restoring civil marriage, emancipation of schools
            from the church, and equality of all confessions in the eye of
            the law. The motion was carried by a hundred and thirty-four
            votes against twenty-two. The Cisleithan (<span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>
            Austrian excluding Hungary) episcopate, with Cardinal Rauscher of
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page336">[pg 336]</span><a name=
            "Pg336" id="Pg336" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Vienna at their
            head, presented an address to his apostolic majesty demanding the
            most rigid preservation of the concordat, denouncing civil
            marriage as concubinage, and the emancipation of schools as their
            dechristianizing. An imperial autograph letter to Rauscher
            rebuked with earnest words the inflammatory proceedings of the
            bishops, and at the same time the ultramontane ambassador to
            Rome, Baron Hübner, was recalled. After the arrangement with
            Hungary was completed, the first Cisleithan, the so-called
            Burger, ministry was constituted under the presidency of Prince
            Auersperg, composed of the most distinguished leaders of the
            parliamentary majority. All the three bills were passed by a
            large majority, and obtained imperial sanction on <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">May 25th,
            1868</span></em>. The papal nuncio of Vienna protested, the pope
            in an allocution denounced the new Austrian constitution as
            <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=

            and the three confessional laws as <span lang="la" class=

            <span class="tei tei-q">“We repudiate and condemn these

            authority, as well as everything done by the Austrian government
            in matters of church policy, and determine in the exercise of the
            same authority that these decrees with all their consequences are
            and shall be null and void.”</span> But all Vienna, all Austria
            held jubilee, and the Chancellor von Beust rejected with energy
            the assumptions of the curia over the civil domain. The bishops
            indeed issued protests and inflammatory pastorals, and forbad the
            publication of the marriage act, but submitted to the threats of
            compulsion by the supreme court, and Bishop Rudigier of Linz, who
            went furthest in inciting to opposition, was in 1869 taken into
            court by the police, and sentenced to twelve days' imprisonment,
            but pardoned by the emperor. Toward the Vatican Council Austria
            assumed at first a waiting policy, then in vain remonstrated,
            warned, threatened, and finally, on July 30th, 1870, after the
            proclamation of infallibility, declared that the concordat was
            antiquated and abolished, because by this dogma the position of
            one of the contracting parties had undergone a complete
            change.</p>

            The storms of this year first set aside the hated official name
            of <span class="tei tei-q">“Non-Catholics,”</span> and won
            permission for Protestant places of worship to have bells and
            towers. But the repeated petitions for permission to found
            branches of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            persistently maintained law that Catholic clergymen, even after
            they had formally become Protestants, could not marry, because
            the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=

            indelibilis</span></span> of priestly consecration attached
            itself even to apostates, and many such facts, prove that the
            government was far from intending to grant to the Protestants
            civil equality with the Catholics. But the unfortunate result of
            the Sardinian-French war <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page337">[pg 337]</span><a name="Pg337" id="Pg337" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> of 1859, and the fear thereby increased of
            the falling asunder of the whole Austrian federation, induced the
            government to address itself earnestly to the introduction of
            liberal institutions, and also to do justice to the Protestant
            church. The presidency of the two Protestant consistories in
            Vienna, hitherto given to a Catholic, was now assigned to a
            Protestant; meetings of the Gustavus Adolphus Union were now
            allowed, and a share was given to the Protestant party in the
            ministry of public worship by the appointment of three
            evangelical councillors. After the entrance on office of the
            liberal minister Von Schmerling, an imperial patent was issued on
            April 8th, 1864, by which unrestricted liberty of faith,
            independent administration of all ecclesiastical, educational,
            and charitable matters, free election of pastors, even from
            abroad, full exercise of civil and political rights, and complete
            equality with Catholics was given to the Protestants of the
            German and Slavonian crown territories. Also in 1868, under the
            reactionary ministry of Belcredi, on the expiry of the legal term
            of the Evangelical Supreme Church Council, it was reorganized,
            two evangelical school councillorships were created, and the
            pecuniary position of the evangelical clergy considerably
            improved. But in spite of all privileges legally granted to the
            evangelical church, it continued in many cases, in presence of
            the concordat, which down to 1870 still remained in force,
            exposed to the whims and caprice, sometimes of the imperial
            courts, sometimes of the Catholic clergy.</p>

            "font-style: italic">Tyrol</span></em>, after the publication of
            the imperial patent of April, 1861, a violent movement was set on
            foot by clerical agitation. The Landtag, by a great majority,
            pronounced the issuing of it the most serious calamity which the
            country, hitherto honest, true, and happy in its undivided
            attachment to the Catholic faith, could have suffered, and
            concluded that Non-Catholics in the Tyrol should only by way of
            dispensation be allowed, but that publicity of Protestant worship
            and formation of Protestant congregations should be still
            forbidden. The Schmerling ministry, indeed, refused to confirm
            these resolutions. The agitation of the clergy, however, which
            fanned in all possible ways the fanaticism of the people, grew
            from year to year, until at last the Belcredi ministry of 1866
            came to an agreement with the Landtag, sanctioned by the emperor,
            according to which the creation of an evangelical landed
            proprietary in the Tyrol was not indeed formally forbidden, but
            permission for an evangelical to possess land had in each case to
            be obtained from the Landtag. The ecclesiastical laws of 1868
            next called forth new conflicts. Twice was the Landtag closed
            because of the opposition thus awakened, until finally in
            September, 1870, the estates took the oath to the new
            constitution with reservation of conscience. But now, when in
            December, 1875, the ministry of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            constituting of two evangelical congregations in the Tyrol, at
            Innsbrück and Meran, the clerical press was filled with burning
            denunciations, and the majority of the Landtag meeting in the
            following March thought to give emphasis to their protest by
            leaving the chamber, and so bringing the assembly to a sudden
            close. In June, 1880, the three bishops of the Tyrol uttered in
            the Landtag a fanatical protest against the continuance of the
            meanwhile established congregations, which the Landtag majority
            renewed in July, 1883.</p>

            which the exclusively Catholic character which had hitherto
            belonged to the Austrian universities, especially those of Vienna
            and Prague, should be removed. Up to this time a Non-Catholic

            theological faculty, and the German language was recommended as
            the medium of instruction. Candidates of theology have to pass
            through a full and comprehensive course of theological science in
            a three years' university curriculum, before they can be admitted
            into an episcopal seminary for practical training. In spite of
            the opposition of the superior clergy, the bill passed even in
            the House of Peers, and became law in 1873.—In Innsbrück, where
            according to ancient custom the rector was chosen from the four
            faculties in succession, the other faculties protested against
            the election when, in 1872, the turn came to the theological
            (Jesuit) faculty, and they carried their point. The new
            organization law gave the choice of rector to the whole
            professoriate, and a subsequent imperial order withdrew from the
            general of the Jesuits the right of nominating all theological
            professors.—Much was done, too, for the elevation of the
            evangelical theological faculty in Vienna by bringing able
            scholars from Germany, by giving a right to the promotion to the
            degree of doctor of theology, etc. But its incorporation in the
            university, though often moved for, was hindered by the continued
            opposition of the Catholic theologians as well as philosophers,
            and in 1873 it did not meet with sufficient support in the House
            of Peers. Even the use of certain halls in the university
            buildings, promised by the minister, could not yet be
            obtained.</p>

            introduced the long-promised Catholic church legislation into the
            Reichstag, intended to supply blanks occasioned by the setting
            aside of the concordat. Its main contents are
            these:</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page339">[pg

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I. The
            concordat, hitherto only diplomatically dealt with, is now
            legislatively annulled; the bishops have to present all their
            manifestoes not before but upon publication to the state
            government for its cognisance; every vacancy of an ecclesiastical
            office, as well as every new appointment to such, is to be
            notified to the civil court, which can raise objections against
            such appointment within thirty days; the minister of worship then
            decides on the admissibility or inadmissibility of the candidate;
            legal deposition of a church officer involves withdrawal of the
            emoluments; the performance of unusual practices in public
            worship of a demonstrative character can be prohibited by the
            civil court; any misuse of ecclesiastical authority in
            restraining any one from obeying the laws of the land or from
            exercising his civil rights is strictly interdicted. II. The
            ecclesiastical revenues and the income of the cloisters are
            subjected to a progressive taxation on behalf of a religious
            fund, mainly for improving the condition of the lower clergy, for
            which the episcopate hitherto, in spite of all entreaties, had
            done practically nothing. III. Newly formed religious societies
            received state recognition if their denomination and principles
            contain nothing contrary to law and morality or offensive to
            those of another faith. IV. The state grants or refuses its
            approval of the establishment of spiritual orders, congregations,
            and ecclesiastical societies; institutions and legacies for them
            amounting to over three thousand gulden require state sanction;
            any member is free to quit any order; all orders must report
            annually on the personal changes and disciplinary punishments
            that have taken place; at any time when occasion calls for it
            they may be subjected to a visitation by the civil court.<a id=

            vain did the pope by an encyclical seek to rouse the episcopate
            to violent opposition, in vain did he adjure the emperor in a
            letter in his own hand not to suffer the church to be put into
            such disgraceful bondage; the House of Deputies approved the four
            bills, and the emperor in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">May, 1874</span></em>, confirmed at least
            the first three, while the fourth was being debated in the House
            of Peers. The bishops now issued a joint declaration that they
            could obey these laws only in so far as they <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“were in harmony with the demands of justice as
            stated in the concordat.”</span> But it did not go to the length
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page340">[pg 340]</span><a name=
            "Pg340" id="Pg340" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of actual
            conflict. Neither to the pope and episcopate, nor to the
            government was such a thing convenient at the time. Hence the
            attitude of reserve on both sides, which kept everything as it
            had been. And when notwithstanding Bishop Rudigier of Linz,
            threatened with fines on account of his refusal to notify the
            newly appointed priests, appealed to the pope, he obtained
            through the Vienna nuncio permission to yield on this point,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"

            did the nuncio strive to prevent the passing of the sweeping
            cloister law. In January, 1876, it was passed in the House of
            Peers with modifications, to which, however, the emperor refused
            his assent. Also the revised marriage law of the same date, which
            removed the hindrances to marriage incorporated even in the book
            of civil law, and no longer recognised differences of religion,
            Christians and non-Christians, the remarriage of separated
            parties of whom at the time of the first marriage only one party
            belonged to the Catholic church, higher consecration and the vows
            of orders, did not pass the House of Peers.</p>

            had by bold action won for the Protestants full equality with the
            Catholics, but in consequence of the revolution, the military
            lordship of the Protestant Haynau in 1850 again put in fetters
            all independent life in both Protestant churches. The Haynau
            decree was, indeed, again abrogated in 1854, but full return to
            the earlier autonomy of the church, in spite of all petitions and
            deputations, could never be regained, all the less as Hungary in
            all too decided a manner rejected the constitutional proposals
            submitted by the Government in 1856. The liberal imperial patent
            of September 1st, 1859, which secured independent administration
            and development to the Protestant church in the crown possessions
            of Hungary, got no better reception. In the German-Slavonian
            districts of North Hungary, as well as in Croatia, Slavonia, and
            Austrian Servia, it was greeted with jubilation and gratitude,
            but the Magyar Hungarians declined on many, for the most part
            frivolous, grounds, mainly because it emanated from the emperor,
            and did not originate in an autonomous synod. When the government
            showed its intention of going forward with it, the opposition was
            carried to the utmost extreme, so that the emperor was obliged
            temporarily to suspend proceedings in May, 1860. Still the
            ecclesiastical joined with the political movement continued to
            increase until in 1867 the imperial chancellor, Von Beust,
            succeeded in quieting both for a time by the Hungarian Agreement.
            On June 8th of that year, the emperor, Francis Joseph, on
            ratifying the agreement, was solemnly crowned King of Hungary.
            The hated patent had been shortly before revoked by an imperial
            edict, with the direction to order church matters in a
            constitutional way. After a <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            Protestant Convention in December, 1867, with the Patent
            congregations, hitherto denounced as unpatriotic, it was
            concluded that to the state belonged only a right of protection
            and oversight of the church, which is autonomous in all its
            internal affairs, but to all confessions perfect freedom in law,
            and that there should be not a separate religious legislation for
            each, but a common one for all confessions. A committee first
            appointed in 1873 for this purpose, with the motto, <span class=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Catholic
            church of Switzerland, after long continued troubles, obtained
            again a regular hierarchical organization in 1828. Since that
            time the Jesuits settled there in crowds, and assumed to
            themselves in most of the Catholic cantons the whole direction of
            church and schools. The unfortunate issue of the cantonal war of
            1847 led indeed to their banishment by law, but, favoured by the
            bishops, they knew how still to re-enter by back doors and
            secretly to regain their earlier influence. The city of Calvin
            was the centre of their plots, not only for Switzerland, but also
            for all Cisalpine Europe, until at last the overstrained bow
            broke, and the Swiss governments became the most decided and
            uncompromising opponents of the ultramontane claims. In 1873 the
            papal nuncio, in consequence of a papal encyclical insulting the
            government, was banished.—In Protestant Switzerland, besides the
            destructive influence of the Illumination, antagonistic to the
            church, and radical liberalism, there appeared a soil receptive
            of pietism, separatism, and fanaticism, whose first cultivation
            has been ascribed to Madame Krüdener (<a href=
            "#Section_176_Para_2" class="tei tei-ref">§ 176, 2</a>). In the
            Protestant church of German Switzerland the religious and
            theological developments stood regularly in lively connexion with
            similar movements in Germany, while those in the French cantons
            received their impulse and support from France and England. From
            France, to which they were allied by a common <span class=

            class="tei tei-ref">§ 165, 14</a>), while travelling Englishmen
            and those residing in the country for a longer period introduced
            the fervour and superstition of Methodism and other sects.</p>

            Switzerland was previously subject to the neighbouring foreign
            bishoprics. But for immediate preservation of its interests the
            curia had appointed a nunciature at Lucerne in 1588. When now, in
            1814, the liberal Wessenberg (<a href="#Section_187_Para_3"
            class="tei tei-ref">§ 187, 3</a>), already long suspected of
            heresy, was called as coadjutor to Constance, the nuncio
            manœuvred with the Catholic confederates till these petitioned
            the pope for the establishment of an independent and national
            bishopric. But when each of the cantons interested claimed to be
            made the episcopal residence negotiations were at last suspended,
            and in 1828 six small bishoprics were erected under immediate
            control of Rome. At the end of 1833 the diocesan representatives
            of Basel and St. Gall assembled in Baden to consult about the
            restoration of a national Swiss Metropolitan Union and a common
            state church constitution for securing church and state against
            the encroachments of the Romish hierarchy. But Gregory XIV.
            condemned the articles of conference here agreed upon, which
            would have given to Switzerland only what other states had long
            possessed, as false, audacious, and erroneous, destructive of the
            church, heretical, and schismatic, and among the Catholic people
            a revolt was stirred up by ultramontane fanaticism, under the
            influence of which the whole action was soon frustrated. On the
            occasion of a revision of the constitution of the canton of
            Aargau, a revolt, led by the cloisters, broke out in 1841. But
            the rebels were defeated, and the grand council resolved upon the
            closing of all cloisters, eight in number. Complaint made against
            this at the diet was regarded as satisfied by the Aargau
            Agreement of 1843 restoring three nunneries. An opposition was
            organized against the revision of the constitution of Canton
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Lucerne</span></em> in 1841. The liberal
            government was overthrown, and the new constitution, in which the
            state insisted on its <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"

            matters and the granting of cantonal civil rights to those only
            who professed attachment to the Roman Catholic church, was
            submitted to the pope for approval. At last, in 1844, the academy
            of Lucerne was given over to the Jesuits, for which Joseph Leu,
            the popular agitator, as member of the grand council, had wrought
            unweariedly since 1839. In Canton <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Vaud</span></em>
            the parties of old or clerical and young Switzerland contended
            with one another for the mastery. The latter suffered an utter
            defeat in 1844, and the constitution which was then carried
            allowed the right of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page343">[pg
            343]</span><a name="Pg343" id="Pg343" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            public worship only to the Catholic church. In consequence of
            this victory of the clerical party Catholic Switzerland with
            Lucerne at its head became a main centre of ultramontanism and
            Jesuitism. At the diet of 1844, indeed, Aargau, supported by
            numerous petitions from the people, moved for the banishment of
            all Jesuits from all Switzerland, but the majority did not
            consent. The Jesuit opponents expelled from Lucerne now organized
            twice over a free volunteer corps to overthrow the ultramontane
            government and force the expulsion of the Jesuits, but on both
            occasions, in 1844 and 1845, it suffered a sore defeat. In face
            of the threateningly growing increase of the excitement, which
            made them fear a decisive intervention of the diet, the Catholic
            cantons formed in 1845 a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            "font-style: italic">Sonderbund</span></span>) for the
            preservation of their faith and their sovereign rights. This
            proceeding, irreconcilable with the Act of Federation, led to a
            civil war. The members of the <span lang="de" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Sonderbund</span></span> were defeated, the
            ultramontane governments had to resign, and the Jesuits departed
            in 1847. The new Federal constitution which Switzerland adopted
            in 1848, secured unconditional liberty of conscience and equality
            of all confessions, and the expulsion of the Jesuits in terms of
            the law. But since that time ultramontanism has gained the
            supremacy in Catholic Switzerland, and in spite of the existing
            law against the Jesuits all the threads of the ultramontane
            clerical movements in Switzerland were in the Jesuits' hands.
            These were never more successful than in Canton <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Geneva</span></em>, where the radical
            democratic agitator Fazy leagued himself closely with
            ultramontanism to compass the destruction of the old Calvinistic
            aristocracy, and by bringing in large numbers the lower class
            Catholics from the neighbouring France and Savoy he obtained a
            considerable Catholic majority in the canton, and in the capital
            itself made Catholics and Protestants nearly equal.</p>

            responsibility, and in 1870 formally renounced all episcopal
            rights over it, so that the pope now appointed the auxiliary
            bishop independent bishop of Geneva, it was evident a step had
            been taken that could not be recalled. The government renewed its
            protest and made it more vehement, in consequence <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page344">[pg 344]</span><a name="Pg344" id=
            "Pg344" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of which, in January, 1873,
            by a papal brief which was first officially communicated to the
            government after it had already been proclaimed from all Catholic
            pulpits, Mermillod was appointed apostolic vicar-general with
            unlimited authority for Canton Geneva, and the district was thus
            practically made a Catholic mission field. A demand made of him
            by the state to resign this office and title and divest himself
            of every episcopal function, was answered by the declaration that
            he would obey God rather than man. The <span lang="de" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Bund</span></span> then expelled him from
            Federal territory until he would yield to that demand. From
            Ferney, where he settled, he unceasingly stirred up the fire of
            opposition among the Genevan clergy and people, but the
            government decidedly rejected all protests, and by a popular vote
            obtained sanction for a Catholic church law which restricted the
            rights of the diocesan bishop who might reside in Switzerland,
            but not in Canton Geneva, and without consent of the government
            could not appoint there any episcopal vicar, and transferred the
            election of priests and priests' vicars to the congregations. The
            next elections returned Old Catholics, since the Roman Catholic
            population did not acknowledge the law condemned by the pope and
            took no part in the voting. By decision of the grand council of
            1875 the abolition of all religious corporations was next
            enacted, and all religious ceremonies and processions in public
            streets and squares forbidden. Leo XIII. made an attempt to still
            the conflict, for in 1879 he gave Bishop Marilley the asked for
            discharge, and confirmed his elected successor, Cosandry, as
            bishop of Freiburg, Lausanne, and Geneva, without however
            removing Mermillod from his office of vicar apostolic of Geneva.
            But this actually took place after the death of Cosandry in 1882
            by the appointment of Mermillod as his successor in 1883. As he
            now ceased to style himself a vicar apostolic, the Federal
            council removed the decree of banishment as the occasion of it
            had ceased, but left each canton free as to whether or not it
            should accept him as bishop. Freiburg, Neuenburg, and Vaud
            accepted him, and Mermillod had a brilliant entry into Freiburg,
            which he made his episcopal residence. But Geneva refused to
            recognise him, because it had already officially attached itself
            to the Old Catholic Bishop Herzog of Berne, and Mermillod went so
            far in his ostentatious love of peace as to declare that he would
            not in future enter Genevan territory.</p>

            comprised the Cantons Bern, Soleure, Aargau, Basel, Thurgau,
            Lucerne, and Zug, had been previously in conflict with the
            diocesan conference, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> the delegates of the
            seven cantons entrusted with the oversight of the ecclesiastical
            administration, on account of introducing the prohibited handbook
            on morals of the Jesuit Gury (<a href="#Section_191_Para_9"
            class="tei tei-ref">§ 191, 9</a>), which ended in the closing of
            the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page345">[pg 345]</span><a name=
            "Pg345" id="Pg345" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> seminary aided by
            the government, and the erection of a new seminary at his own
            cost. Although the diocesan conference next forbad the
            proclamation of the new Vatican dogma, the bishop threatened
            excommunicated Egli in Lucerne in 1871, and Geschwind in
            Starrkirch in 1872, who refused. The conference ordered the
            withdrawal of this unlawful act, and on the bishop's refusal,
            deposed him in January, 1873. The dissenting cantons, Lucerne and
            Zug, indeed declared that after as well as before they would only
            recognise Lachat as lawful bishop, the chapter refused to make
            the required election of administrator of the diocese, the clergy
            in Soleure and in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Bernese Jura</span></em> without exception
            took the side of the bishop, as also by means of a popular vote
            the great majority of Catholics in Thurgau. But amid all this the
            conference did not yield in the least. Lachat was compelled by
            the police to quit his episcopal residence, and withdrew to a
            village in Canton Lucerne. The council of the Bernese government
            resolved to recall the refractory clergy of the Jura, took their
            names off the civil register and forbad them to exercise any
            clerical functions. The outbreaks incited by rebel clergy in the
            Jura were put down by the military, sixty-nine clergymen were
            exiled, and, so far as the means allowed, replaced by liberal
            successors introduced by the Old Catholic priest Herzog (<a href=
            "#Section_190_Para_3" class="tei tei-ref">§ 190, 3</a>) in Olten.
            In November, 1875, permission to return home was granted to the
            exiles in consequence of the revised Federal constitution of
            1874, according to which the banishment of Swiss burghers was no
            longer allowed. The Bernese government felt all the more disposed
            to carry out this enactment of the National Council, as it
            believed that it had obtained the legal means for checking
            further rebellion and obstinacy among those who should return. On
            January, 1874, by popular vote a law was sanctioned reorganizing
            the whole ecclesiastical affairs of the <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Canton
            Bern</span></em>. By it all clergy, Catholic as well as
            Protestant, are ranked as civil officers, the choice of whom
            rests with the congregations, the tenure of office lasting for
            six years. All purely ecclesiastical affairs for the canton rest
            in the last instance with a synod of the particular denomination,
            for the several congregations with a church committee, both
            composed of freely elected lay and clerical members. But if a
            dispute in a particular congregation should arise about a synodal
            decree, the congregational assembly decides on its validity or
            non-validity for the particular congregation. All decrees of
            higher church courts and pastorals must have state approval,
            which must never be refused on dogmatic grounds. If a
            congregation splits over any question, the majority claims the
            church property and pastor's emoluments, etc. And this law was
            next extended in October 31st, 1875, in the matter of penal law
            by the so-called Police Worship Law. It imposes heavy fines up to
            1000 francs or a year's imprisonment for any clerical agitation
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page346">[pg 346]</span><a name=
            "Pg346" id="Pg346" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> against the law,
            institutions or enactments of the civil courts, as well as for
            every outbreak of hostilities against members of other religious
            bodies, refuses to allow any interference of foreign spiritual
            superiors without leave granted by government in each particular
            case, forbids all processions and religious ceremonies outside of
            the fixed church locality, etc. In the same year the first
            Catholic Cantonal Synod declared its attachment to the Christian
            or Old Catholic church of Switzerland. But it was otherwise after
            the newly elected Grand Council of the canton of its own accord,
            on September 12th, 1878, granted the returned Jura clergy
            complete amnesty for all the past, and on the assumption of
            future submission to existing laws of state, recognised them
            again eligible for election to spiritual offices which had
            previously been denied them. Not only did the Roman Catholic
            people regularly take part in elections of priests, church
            councils, and synods, undoubtedly with the approval of the new
            pope Leo XIII., who had in February addressed a conciliatory
            letter to the members of the Federal Council, but also the
            extremest of the Jura now submitted without scruple to the new
            election required by the law, and won therein for the most part
            the majority of votes. In the Catholic Cantonal Synod convened in
            Bern, in January, 1880, were found seventy-five Roman Catholics
            and only twenty-five Old Catholic deputies. The latter were
            naturally defeated in all controversies. The synod declared that
            the connexion with the Christian Catholic national bishopric was
            annulled, that auricular confession was obligatory, that
            marriages of priests were forbidden, etc. Since now the law
            assigns the state pay of the priest as well as all the church
            property in the case of a split to the majority for the time
            being, the inevitable consequence was that Old Catholics of the
            Jura district were deprived of all share in these privileges, and
            had to make provision for their own support. Also in Canton
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Soleure</span></em>, the law that all
            pastors must be re-elected after the expiry of six years, came in
            force in 1872, and then the thirty-two Roman Catholic clergymen
            concerned were with only two exceptions re-elected, while, on the
            other hand, the Old Catholic priest Geschwind of Starrkirch was
            rejected.—But all efforts to restore the bishopric of
            Basel-Soleure came to grief over the person of Bishop Lachat,
            whom the curia would not give up and the Federal Council would
            not again allow, until at last a way out of the difficulty was
            found. The canton Tessin, which previously in church matters
            belonged to the Italian dioceses of Milan and Como, was, in 1859,
            by decree of the Federal Council, detached from these. But Tessin
            insisted on the founding of a bishopric of its own, while the
            Federal Council wished to join it to the bishopric of Chur. Thus
            the matter remained undecided, till in September, 1884, the papal
            curia came to an understanding with the Federal Council
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page347">[pg 347]</span><a name=
            "Pg347" id="Pg347" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> that Lachat should
            be appointed vicar-apostolic for the newly founded bishopric of
            Tessin, and that to the vacated bishopric of Basel-Soleure the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“learned as well as mild”</span> Provost
            Fiala of Soleure should be called. In this way all the cantons
            referred to, with the exception of Bern, were won.<a id=

            which unweariedly prosecuted the work of home and foreign
            missions, fell most completely under the influence of rationalism
            and then of the liberal Protestant theology. While pietism
            obtained powerful support and encouragement in its missionary
            institutions and movements, and there, though developing itself
            on Reformed soil, assumed, in consequence of its manifold
            connection with Germany, a colour almost more Lutheran than
            Reformed, the university by eminent theological teachers of
            scientific ability represented the Mediation school in theology
            of a predominantly Reformed type. In the Canton <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Zürich</span></em>, on the other hand, the
            advanced theology, theoretical and practical, obtained an
            increasing and finally an almost exclusive mastery in the
            university and church. But yet, when in 1839 the Grand Council
            called Dr. David Strauss to a theological professorship, the
            Zürich people rose to a man against the proposal, the appointment
            was not enforced, the Grand Council was overthrown, and Strauss
            pensioned. The victory and ascendency of this reaction, however,
            was not of long continuance. Theological and ecclesiastical
            radicalism again won the upper hand and maintained it unchecked.
            In the other German cantons the most diverse theological schools
            were represented alongside of one another, yet with steadily
            increasing advantage to liberal and radical tendencies. The
            theological faculty at <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Bern</span></em> favoured mainly a liberal
            mediation theology, and an attempt of the orthodox party in 1847,
            to set aside the appointment of Professor E. Zeller by means of a
            popular tumult, miscarried. From 1860 ecclesiastical liberalism
            prevailed in German Protestant Switzerland, frequently going the
            length of the extremest radicalism and showing its influence even
            in the cantonal and synodal legislation. The starting of the

            radical liberal movement in Swiss theology. In Fred. Langhans,
            since 1876 professor at Bern, he had a zealous comrade in the
            fight. During 1864-1866, Langhans published a series of violent
            controversial tracts against the pietistic orthodox party in
            Switzerland, which zealously prosecuted foreign missions, and in

            pretty strongly represented, especially in the aristocracy, the
            emancipation of the schools from the church and the introduction
            of obligatory civil marriage were accomplished in most cantons,
            even before the revised Federal constitution of 1874 and the
            marriage law of 1875 gave to these principles legal sanction
            throughout the whole of Switzerland. In almost all Protestant
            cantons the re-election or new election to all spiritual offices
            every six years was ordained by law, in many the freeing of the
            clergy from any creed subscription with the setting aside of
            confessional writings as well as of the orthodox liturgy,
            hymnbooks and catechisms was also carried, and the withdrawing of
            the Apostles' Creed from public worship and from the baptismal
            formula was enjoined. The Basel synod in 1883, by thirty-six to
            twenty-seven votes, carried the motion to make baptism no longer
            a condition of confirmation; and although the Zürich synod in
            1882 still held baptism obligatory for membership in the national
            church, the Cantonal Council in 1883, on consulting the law of
            the church, overturned this decision by 140 against 19 votes.</p>

            rationalistic tendency. Notwithstanding, or just because of this,
            Madame Krüdener, in 1814, with her conventicle pietism, found an
            entrance there, and won in the young theologian Empaytaz a
            zealous supporter and an apostle of conversion preaching. In the
            next year a wealthy Englishman, Haldane, appeared there as the
            apostle of methodistic piety, and inspired the young pastor Malan
            with enthusiasm for the revival mission. Empaytaz and Malan now
            by speech and writing charged the national church with defection

            of abuse. The persecution came to an end in 1830. Thereafter
            settling down in quiet moderation, it founded in 1831 the
            <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "fr"><span style="font-style: italic">Société
            évangélique</span></span>, which, in 1832, established an

            "fr"><span style="font-style: italic">Ecole de
            Théologie</span></span>, and became the centre of the Free church
            evangelical movement. From that time the <span lang="fr" class=

            "font-style: italic">Eglise Nationale</span></span>, and the
            opposition at first so violent has been moderated on both sides
            by the growth of conciliatory and mediating tendencies. Since
            1850, two divergent parties have arisen within the bosom of the
            free church itself, which without any serious conflict continued
            alongside of one another, until in May, 1883, the majority of the
            presbytery resolved to make a peaceful separation, the stricter
            forming the congregation of the <span lang="fr" class=

            liberal that of the <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign"
            xml:lang="fr"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Oratoire</span></span>. At the same time a
            committee was appointed to draw up a confession upon which both
            could unite in lasting fellowship. But when this failed, a formal
            and complete separation was agreed upon at the new year.—From
            Geneva the Methodist revival spread to <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Vaud</span></em>.
            The religious movement got a footing, especially in Lausanne. The
            Grand Council, however, did not allow the contemplated formation
            of an independent congregation, and in 1824 forbad all
            <span class="tei tei-q">“sectarian”</span> assemblies, while the
            mob raged even more wildly than at Geneva against the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class=
            "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Momiers</span></span>.”</span> The
            excitement increased when, in 1839, by decision of the Grand
            Council, the Helvetic Confession was abrogated. When in 1845 a
            revolutionary radical government came into office at Lausanne,
            the refusal of many clergymen to read from the pulpit a political
            proclamation, caused a thorough division in the church, for the
            preachers referred to were in a body driven out of the national
            church. A Free church of Vaud now developed itself alongside of
            the national church, sorely oppressed and persecuted by the
            radical government, and spread into other Swiss cantons. It owed
            its freedom from sectarian narrowness mainly to the influence of
            the talented and thoroughly independent Alex. Vinet, who devoted
            his whole energies and brilliant eloquence to the interests of
            religious freedom and liberty of conscience and to the struggle
            for the separation of church and state. Vinet was from 1817
            teacher of the French language and literature in Basel, then from
            1837 to 1845 professor of practical theology at Lausanne, but on
            the reconstruction of the university he was not re-elected. He
            died in 1847.<a id="noteref_109" name="noteref_109" href=

            conscience, freedom in teaching and worship without any sort of
            restriction on clergy, teachers and congregations. <span class=

            notwithstanding the almost unanimous protest of the evangelical
            synod, and refused to appeal to a popular vote. When an appeal to
            the Federal Council proved fruitless, somewhere about one half of
            the pastors, including the theological professors and all the
            students, left the state church, and formed an <span lang="fr"

            so long as they were not hindered from preaching God's word in
            purity and simplicity. Both parties had a common meeting point in
            the <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "fr"><span style="font-style: italic">Union
            évangélique</span></span>, and a law originally passed in favour
            of the Old Catholics, which secured to all seceders a right to
            the joint use of their respective churches, proved also of
            advantage to the Free church.—The canton <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Geneva</span></em> issued, in 1874, a
            Protestant law of worship, which with dogma and liturgy also
            threw overboard ordination, and maintained that the clergy are
            answerable only to their conscience and their electors. Yet at
            the new election of the consistory in 1879, at the close of the
            legal term of four years, the evangelical and moderate party
            again obtained the supremacy, and a law introduced by the radical
            party in the Grand Council, demanding the withdrawal of the
            budget of worship and the separation of church and state, was, on
            July 4th, 1880, thrown out by universal popular vote, by a
            majority of 9,000 to 4,000.</p>

            serious mistakes in the new partition of states at the Vienna
            Congress was the combining in one kingdom of the United
            Netherlands the provinces of Holland and Belgium, diverse in
            race, language, character, and religion. The contagion of French
            Revolution of July, 1830, however, caused an outbreak in
            Brussels, which ended in the separation of Catholic Belgium from
            the predominantly Protestant Holland. Belgium has since then been
            the scene of unceasing and changeful conflicts between the
            liberal and ultramontane parties, whose previous combination was
            now completely shattered. And while, on the other hand, in the
            Reformed state church of Holland, theological studies, leaning
            upon German science, have taken a liberal and even radical
            destructive course, the not inconsiderable Roman <span class=

            "font-style: italic">The United Netherlands.</span></em>—The
            constitution of the new kingdom created in 1814 guaranteed
            unlimited freedom to all forms of worship and complete equality
            of all citizens without distinction of religious confession.
            Against this the Belgian episcopate protested with bishop Maurice
            von Broglie, of Ghent, at their head, who refused, in 1817, the
            prayers of the church for the heretical crown princess and the
            <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "la"><span style="font-style: italic">Te Deum</span></span> for
            the newborn heir to the throne. As he went so far as to excite
            the Catholic people on all occasions against the Protestant
            government, the angry king, William I., summoned him to answer
            for his conduct before the court of justice. But he eluded
            inquiry by flight to France, and as guilty of high treason was
            sentenced to death, which did not prevent him from his exile
            unweariedly fanning the flames of rebellion. The number of
            cloisters grew from day to day and also the multitude of clerical
            schools and seminaries, in which the Catholic youth was trained
            up in the principles of the most violent fanaticism. The
            government in 1825 closed the seminaries, expelled Jesuit
            teachers, forbad attendance at Jesuit schools abroad, and founded
            a college at Louvain, in which all studying for the church were
            obliged to pass through a philosophical curriculum. The common
            struggle for maintaining the liberty of instruction promised by
            the constitution made political radicalism and ultramontanism
            confederates, and the government, intimidated by this
            combination, agreed, in a concordat with the pope in 1827, to
            modify the obligatory into a facultative attendance at Louvain
            College. The inevitable consequence of this was the speedy and
            complete decay of the college. But the confederacy of the
            radicals and ultramontanes continued, directing itself against
            other misdeeds of the government, and was not broken up until in
            1830 it attained its object by the disjunction of Belgium and
            Holland.</p>

            rationalism and latitudinarian supernaturalism had to such an
            extent blotted out the ecclesiastical distinctions between
            Reformed, Remonstrants, Mennonites, and Lutherans, that the
            clergy of one party would unhesitatingly preach in the churches
            of the others. Then rose the poet Bilderdijk, driven from
            political into religious patriotism, to denounce with glowing
            fury the general declension from the orthodoxy of Dort. Two
            Jewish converts of his, the poet and apologist Isaac da Costa,
            and the physician Cappadose, gave him powerful support. A zealous
            young clergyman, Henry de Cock, was theological mouthpiece of the
            party. Because he offended church <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page352">[pg 352]</span><a name="Pg352" id="Pg352" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> order, especially by ministering in other
            congregations, he was suspended and finally deposed in 1834. The
            greater part of his congregation and four other pastors with him
            formally declared their secession from the unfaithful church, as
            a return to the orthodox Reformed church. As separatists and
            disturbers of public worship, they were fined and imprisoned, and
            were at last satisfied with the recognition granted them of royal
            grace in 1839, as a separate or <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Christian
            Reformed Church</span></em>. It consists now of 364
            congregations, embracing about 140,000 souls, with a flourishing
            seminary at Kampen. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Reformed State Church</span></em>, with
            three-fourths of all the Protestant population, persevered in and
            developed its liberalistic tendencies. The State Synod of 1883
            expressly declared that the Netherland Reformed Church demands
            from its teachers not agreement with all the statements of the
            confessional writings, but only with their spirit, gist, and
            essence; and the synod of 1877, by the vote of a majority, stated
            that no sort of formulated confession should be required even of
            candidates for confirmation. Yet even amid such proceedings from
            various sides, a churchly and evangelical reaction of
            considerable importance set in. Three great parties within the
            state church carried on a life and death struggle with one
            another: (1) The Strict Calvinists, whose leader is Dr. Kuyper,
            formerly pastor in Amsterdam; (2) The so-called Middle Party,
            which falls into two divisions: the, just about expiring, Ethical
            Irenical Party, with the Utrecht professor Van Oosterzee (died
            1882), and the Evangelical Party with the Gröningen professor
            Hofstede de Groot, since 1872 Emeritus, as leaders, of which the
            former, subordinating the confession, regards the Christian life
            as the main thing in Christianity, and the latter declares itself
            prepared to take the gospel alone for its creed and confession;
            and (3) The so-called Modern Party, which, with Professors
            Scholten and Kuenen as leaders, has its centre at Leyden, and in
            theology carries out with reckless energy the destructive
            critical principles of the school of Baur and Wellhausen (§ 182,

            "font-style: italic">Confessional Union</span></em>”</span> holds
            its annual meetings at Utrecht, and operates by means of
            evangelists and lay preachers in places where there are only
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Modern”</span> pastors. The higher and
            cultured classes in the congregations mostly favour the Gröningen
            and some also the Leyden school, but the great majority of the
            middle and lower classes are adherents of Kuyper, and have
            frequently secured majorities in the Congregational Church
            Council.—The Dutch school law of 1856 banished every sort of
            confessional religious education from public schools supported by
            the state, and so called forth the erection of numerous
            denominational schools <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page353">[pg
            353]</span><a name="Pg353" id="Pg353" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            independent of the state, and the founding of a <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Union for Christian Popular
            Education</span></em>,”</span> which has spread through the whole
            country. The university law sanctioned, after violent debates in
            the chamber, in 1876, establishes in place of the old theological
            faculties, professorships for the science of religion generally,
            with the exception of dogmatics and practical theology, and left
            it with the Reformed State Synod to care for these two subjects,
            either in a theological seminary or by founding for itself the
            two theological professorships in the universities and supporting
            them from the sums voted for the state church. The synod decided
            on the latter course, and appointed to the new chairs men of
            moderate liberal views. The adherents of the strict Calvinistic
            party, however, founded a Free Reformed University at Amsterdam,
            which was opened in autumn, 1880. Its first rector was
            Kuyper.—The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Lutheran Church</span></em> of fifty
            congregations and sixty-two pastors, with about 60,000 souls, has
            also had since 1816 a theological seminary. In it neological
            tendencies prevail.</p>

            "tei tei-anchor"></a> 3. The founding of the Free University at
            Amsterdam, referred to above, led to a series of violent
            conflicts which threatened to break up the whole Reformed church
            of the Netherlands by a wild schism. The Reformed State Synod,
            consisting mainly of Gröningen theologians, but also numbering
            many members belonging to the Modern or Leyden school, and
            constituting the supreme ecclesiastical court, had, in spite of
            its eleventh rule, which makes <span class="tei tei-q">“the
            maintenance of the doctrine”</span> a main task of all church
            government, for a long time admitted the principle of unfettered
            freedom of teaching, and ordained that even evidence of orthodoxy
            on the part of candidates for confirmation would no longer be
            regarded as a condition of their acceptance, their examination
            referring only to their knowledge, the examining clergy and not
            the assisting elders being judges in this matter. When now the
            Free University had been founded in direct opposition to the
            synod, the latter resolved to reject all its pupils at the
            examination of candidates, and when, in the summer of 1885, its
            first student presented himself, actually carried out this
            resolution. Thereupon the university transferred the examination
            to a committee, elected by itself, consisting of orthodox
            Reformed pastors and elders, and a small village congregation
            agreed to elect the candidate for its poorly endowed, and so for
            seventeen years vacant, pastorate. But the synod refused him
            ordination. Therefore the director of a strict Calvinistic
            Gymnasium, formerly a pastor, performed the ceremony, and the
            congregation announced its secession from the synodal union. At
            the same time in Amsterdam a second conflict arose over the
            question of candidates for confirmation. Three pastors of the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“modern”</span> school demanded the
            elders subject to them, among them Dr. Kuyper, to take part as
            required in the examining of their <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page354">[pg 354]</span><a name="Pg354" id="Pg354" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> candidates; but these refused to give their
            assistance, because the previous training had not been according
            to Scripture and the confession, and also the majority of the
            church council approved of this refusal, as the parents had
            complained, and declared that the certificate of morality
            demanded by other pastors could be made out only if candidates
            for confirmation had previously formally and solemnly confessed
            their genuine and hearty faith in Jesus Christ as the only and
            all-sufficient Saviour, which these, however, in accordance with
            the Dutch practice of the eighteenth century, declined to do. The
            controversy was carried by appeal through all the church courts,
            and finally the State Synod ordered the church council to make
            delivery of the certificates within six weeks on pain of
            suspension. But this was brought about before the expiry of that
            period by the outbreak of a far more serious conflict over
            matters of administration. In Amsterdam the administration of
            church property lay with a special commission, responsible to the
            church council, consisting of members, one half from the church
            council and the other half from the congregations. If in the
            beginning of January, 1886, the threatened suspension and
            deposition of the church council should be carried out, in
            accordance with proper order until the appointment of a new
            council all the rights of the same, therefore also that of
            supervising that commission, would fall to the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“classical board”</span> (§ 143, 1) as the next
            highest court. In order to avoid this, the fateful resolution was
            passed on December 14th, 1885, to alter § 41 of the regulations,
            so that, if the church council in the discharge of its duty to
            govern the community in accordance with God's word and the
            legalized church confession, it would be so hindered therein that
            it might feel in conscience obliged to obey God rather than man
            and accept suspension and deposition, and a church council should
            be appointed, the administrative commission would be obliged to
            remain subject, not to this, but to the original commission. The
            <span class="tei tei-q">“classical board”</span> annulled this
            resolution, suspended on January 4th, 1886, for continued
            obstinacy the previous church council, and constituted itself,
            pending decision on the part of discipline, interim administrator
            of all its rights and duties. The suspended majority, however,
            called a meeting for the same day, and when it found the doors of
            its meeting place closed, sent for a locksmith to break them
            open. They were prevented by the police, who then, by putting on
            a safety lock, strengthening the boards of the door by mailed
            plates, and setting a watch, greatly reduced the chances of an
            entrance. But the opposition sent to the watchers a letter by a
            policeman demanding that the representatives of the church
            council should be allowed to pass; upon which these, regarding it
            as an order of the police, withdrew. They then had the mailed
            plates sawn, took possession of the hall <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page355">[pg 355]</span><a name="Pg355" id="Pg355" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> and the archives and treasure box lying
            there, and refused admission to the classical board. While then
            the question of law and possession was referred to the courts of
            law, and there the final decision would not be given before the
            lapse of a year, the disciplinary procedure took its course
            through all the ecclesiastical courts and ended in the deposition
            of all resisting elders and pastors. The latter preached now to
            great crowds in hired halls. From the capital the excitement
            increased by means of violent publications on both sides, spread
            over the whole land and produced discord in many other
            communities. Wild and uproarious tumults first broke out in
            Leidendorf, a suburb of Leyden. The pastor and the majority of
            the church council refused to enter on their congregational list
            two girls who had been confirmed by liberal churchmen elsewhere,
            and with by far the greater part of the congregation seceded from
            the synodal union. The classical board now, in July, 1886,
            declared the pastorate vacant, and ordered that a regular interim
            service should be conducted on Sundays by the pastors of the
            circuit. The uproar among the people, however, was thereby only
            greatly increased, so that the civil authorities were obliged to
            protect the deputed preachers, by a large military escort, from
            rude maltreatment, and to secure quiet during public worship by a
            company of police in church. And similar conflicts soon broke out
            on like occasions and with similar consequences in many other
            places throughout all parts of the land. In December, 1886, the
            Amsterdam church council also declared its secession from the
            state church, and a numerously attended <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Reformed Church Congress”</span> at Amsterdam, in
            January, 1887, summoned by Kuyper in the interests of the crowd
            of seceders, resolved to accept the decision of the law in regard
            to church property.<a id="noteref_110" name="noteref_110" href=

            there was still left a considerable number of <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Catholics</span></em>, about three-eighths
            of the population, most numerous in Brabant, Limburg, and
            Luxemburg, and these were, as of old, inclined to the most
            bigoted ultramontanism. This tendency was greatly enhanced when
            the new constitutional law of 1848 announced the principle of
            absolute liberty of belief, in consequence of which the Jesuits
            crowded in vast numbers, and the pope in 1853 organized a new
            Catholic hierarchy in the land, with four bishops and an
            archbishop at Utrecht, under the control of the propaganda. The
            Protestant population went into great excitement over this. The
            liberal ministry of Thorbecke was obliged to resign, but the
            chambers at length sanctioned the papal ordinance, only securing
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page356">[pg 356]</span><a name=
            "Pg356" id="Pg356" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the Protestant
            population against its misapplication and abuse.—On the
            withdrawal of the French in 1814 there were only eight cloisters
            remaining; but in 1861 there were thirty-nine for monks and 137
            for nuns, and since then the number has considerably
            increased.—The Dutch <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            "font-style: italic">The Kingdom of Belgium.</span></em>—Catholic
            Belgium obtained after its separation from Holland a constitution
            by which unlimited freedom of religious worship and education,
            and the right of confessing opinion and of associating, were
            guaranteed, and to the state was allowed no interference with the
            affairs of the church beyond the duty of paying the clergy. Also
            in Leopold I., 1830-1865, of the house of Saxe-Coburg, it had a
            king who though himself a Protestant was faithful to the
            constitution, and, according to agreement, had his children
            trained up in the Roman Catholic church. The confederacy of
            radicalism and ultramontanism, however, was broken by the
            irreconciliable enmity and violent conflict in daily life and in
            the chambers among clerical and liberal ministers. The
            ultramontanes founded at Louvain in 1834 a strictly Catholic
            university, which was under the oversight of the bishops and the
            patronage of the Virgin; while the liberals promoted the erection
            of an opposition university for free science at Brussels. That
            the Jesuits used to the utmost for their own ends the liberty
            granted them by the constitution by means of missions and the
            confessional, schools, cloisters, and brotherhoods of every kind
            is what might have been expected. But liberalism also knew how to
            conduct a propaganda and to bring the clergy into discredit with
            the educated classes by unveiling their intrigues,
            legacy-hunting, etc., while these exercised a great influence
            chiefly upon bigoted females. The number of cloisters, which on
            the separation from Holland amounted only to 280, had risen in
            1880 in that small territory to 1,559, with 24,672 inmates, of
            whom 20,645 were nuns.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><a name=
            "Section_200_Para_6" id="Section_200_Para_6" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> 6. After the ultramontane party had enjoyed
            eight years of almost unchallenged supremacy, the Malou ministry
            favourable to it was overthrown in June, 1878, and a liberal
            government, under the presidency of Frère-Orban, took its place.
            Then began the <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "de"><span style="font-style: italic">Kulturkampf</span></span>
            in Belgium. The charge of public education was taken from the
            ministry of the interior, and a special minister appointed in the
            person of Van Humbeeck. He began by changing all girls' schools
            under the management of sisters of spiritual orders into communal
            schools, and in January, 1879, brought in a bill for reorganizing
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page357">[pg 357]</span><a name=
            "Pg357" id="Pg357" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> elementary
            education, which completely secularized the schools; deprived the
            clergy of all official influence over them, and relegated
            religious instruction to the care of the family and the church,
            the latter, however, having the necessary accommodation allowed
            in the school buildings. The chambers approved the bill, and the
            king confirmed it, in spite of all protests and agitation by the
            clergy. The clerical journals put a black border on their issue
            which published it; the provincial councils under clerical
            influence nullified as far as possible all money bequests for the
            public schools, and the bishops assembled in August at Mechlin
            resolved to found free schools in all communities, and to refuse
            absolution to all parents who entrusted their children to state
            schools and all teachers in them, in order thus to cause a
            complete decay of the public schools, which indeed happened to
            this extent that within a few months 1,167 communal schools had
            not a single Catholic scholar. On complaint being made by the
            government to Leo XIII., he expressed through the Brussels nuncio
            his regret and disapproval of the proceedings of the bishops;
            but, on the other hand, he not only privately praised them on
            account of their former zeal in opposing the school law, but also
            incited them to continued opposition. When this double dealing of
            the curia was discovered, the government in June, 1880, broke off
            all diplomatic relations with the Vatican by recalling their
            ambassador and giving the nuncio his passports. The ministerial
            president publicly in the chamber of deputies characterized the
            action of the Holy See as <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang=
            "fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">fourberie</span></span>.”</span> Whereupon
            the pope at the next consistory called princes and peoples as
            witnesses of this insult. In May, 1882, the results of the
            inquiry into clerical incitements against the public was read in
            the chamber, where such startling revelations were made as these:
            Priests taught the children that they should no longer pray for
            the king when he had committed the mortal sin of confirming the
            school law; the ministers are worse than murderers and true
            Herods; a priest even taught children to pray that God might
            cause their <span class="tei tei-q">“liberal”</span> parents to
            die, etc. Amid such conflicts the Catholic party in parliament
            split into the parties of the <span class=
            "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Politici</span></span>, who were willing to
            submit to the constitution, and that of the <span class=
            "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Intransigenti</span></span>, who, under the
            direction of the bishops and the university of Louvain, held high
            above everything the standard of the syllabus. The latter fought
            with such passionateness, that the pope felt obliged in 1881 to
            enjoin upon the episcopate <span class="tei tei-q">“that prudent
            attitude”</span> which the church in such cases always maintains
            in <span class="tei tei-q">“enduring many evils”</span> which for
            the time cannot be overcome. But undeterred, the government
            continued to restrict the claims of the clergy, so far as these
            were not expressly guaranteed by the constitution.—In June, 1884,
            as the result of the elections for the chamber of deputies, the
            clerical <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page358">[pg
            358]</span><a name="Pg358" id="Pg358" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            party again were in power. Malou was once more at the head of a
            ministry in favour of the clericals, caused the king to dissolve
            the senate, and in the new elections won there also a majority
            for his party. No sooner were they in power than the clerical
            ministry, in conjunction with the majority in the chambers,
            proceeded with inconsiderate haste, amid the most violent, almost
            daily repeated explosions from the now intensely embittered
            liberal and radical section of the population, which only seemed
            to increase their zeal, to employ their absolute power to the
            utmost in the interest of clericalism. The restoration of
            diplomatic relations with the papal curia in the spirit of
            absolute acquiescence in its schemes was the grand aim of the
            reaction, as well as a new school law by which the schools were
            completely given over again to the clergy and the orders. But
            when at the next communal elections a liberal majority was
            returned, and protests of the new communal councils poured in
            against the school law on behalf of the vast number of state
            certificated teachers reduced by it to hunger and destitution,
            the Malou ministry found itself obliged to resign in October,
            1884. Its place was taken by the moderate ultramontane Beernaert
            ministry, which sought indeed to quiet the excitement by mild
            measures, but held firmly in all essential points to the
            principles of its predecessor.</p>

            <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "de"><span style="font-style: italic">Kulturkampf</span></span>
            is presented by the appearance of Bishop <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Dumont of
            Tournay</span></em>, who, previously an enthusiastic admirer of
            Pius IX. and a vigorous defender of the infallibility dogma, also
            a zealous patron of stigmatization miracles at Bois d'Haine
            (<a href="#Section_188_Para_4" class="tei tei-ref">§ 188, 4</a>),
            now suddenly turned round on the school question and refused to
            obey the papal injunction. For this he was first suspended, and
            then in 1880 formally deposed by the pope. He afterwards wrote
            letters in the most advanced liberal journals with violent
            denunciations of the pope, whom he would not recognise as pope,
            but only as Bishop of Rome, and so styled him not Leo, but only
            Pecci. In these letters Dumont makes the interesting
            communication that the virgin Louise Lateau, favoured of God, has
            threatened with excommunication the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“intruder”</span> Durousseaux, nominated by the pope
            as his successor, because she continues to reverence Dumont as
            the only legitimate Bishop of Tournay. The Vatican pronounced him
            insane, and the chapter appealed to the civil authorities to have
            him declared incapable in the sight of the law, which, however,
            they refused, because they could not regard Dumont's insanity as
            proved. On the other hand, Dumont refused to renounce his
            episcopal office, and accused Durousseaux of having by night,
            with the help of a locksmith, obtained entrance to his episcopal
            palace, and having taken forcible possession of a casket lying
            there, which, besides the diocesan property to the value of five
            millions, contained also about one and a <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page359">[pg 359]</span><a name="Pg359" id="Pg359" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> half millions of his own private means.
            Pending the issue of the conflict, as to which of the two should
            be regarded as the true bishop, the palace was now officially
            sealed up. The attempt to arrest the robbed casket had to be
            abandoned, because meanwhile the canon Bernard, as keeper of the
            treasures of the diocese, had fled with its contents to America.
            He was, however, on legal warrant imprisoned in Havanna and
            brought back to Belgium in 1882. In April, 1884, the dispute of
            the bishops was definitively closed by the judgment of the
            supreme tribunal, according to which Dumont, having been
            legitimately deposed, has no more claim to the title and revenues
            of his earlier office; and in 1886 the supreme court of appeal at
            Brussels condemned Bernard <span class="tei tei-q">“on account of
            serious breach of trust”</span> to three years' imprisonment.</p>

            Society at Brussels with thirty-four pastors and evangelists, the
            work of evangelization not only among Catholic Walloons, but also
            among the Flemish population, has made considerable progress,
            notwithstanding all agitation and incitement of the people by the
            Catholic clergy, so that several new evangelical congregations,
            consisting mostly of converts, have been formed. In two small
            places indeed the whole communities, roused by episcopal
            arbitrariness, have gone over.—The pastor Byse employed by the
            Evangelical Society at Brussels has taken up the idea that all
            men by the fall have lost their immortality, and that it could be
            restored again by faith in Christ, while all the unreconciled are
            given over to annihilation, the second death of Revelation ii.
            11, xx. 15. So long as he maintained this theory merely as a
            private opinion the society took no offence at it, but when he
            began to proclaim it in his preaching and in his instruction of
            the young, and declined to yield to all advice on the matter, the
            synod of 1882 resolved upon his dismissal. But a great part of
            his congregation still remain faithful to him.</p>

            a completely diversified course. While in Denmark the civil life

            tenacity almost unparalleled in Protestant countries, has for a
            long period held fast in exclusive attachment to the idea of a
            state church. On the other hand Denmark was far more open to
            influences from without hostile to the church, on the one side
            those of rationalism, on the other, those of the
            anti-ecclesiastical sects, especially of the Baptists and
            Mormons, than Sweden, which in its certainly barren, if not
            altogether dead orthodoxy till after the middle of the century
            was almost hermetically sealed against all heterogeneous
            influences, but yet could not altogether over-master the
            pietistically or methodistically coloured movements of religious
            yearning that arose among her own people. Norway, again, although
            politically united with Sweden, has, both in national character
            and in religious development, shown its more intimate
            relationship with Denmark.</p>

            "font-style: italic">Denmark.</span></em>—From the close of last
            century rationalism has had a home in Denmark. In 1825 Professor
            Clausen, a moderate adherent of the neological school, published
            a learned work on the opposition of <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Catholicism and Protestantism,”</span> identifying
            the latter with rationalism. First of all in that same year
            Pastor <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Grundtvig</span></em> (died 1872),
            <span class="tei tei-q">“a man of poetic genius, and skilled in
            the ancient history of the land,”</span> inspired with equal
            enthusiasm for the old Lutheranism of his fathers and for
            patriotic Danism, entered the lists and replied with powerful
            eloquence, lamenting the decay of Christianity and the church. He
            was condemned by the court of justice as injurious, after he had
            during the process resigned his pastoral office. A like fate
            befell the orientalist Lindberg, who charged Clausen with the
            breach of his ordination vow. The adherents of Grundtvig met for
            mutual edification in conventicles, until at last in 1832 he
            obtained permission again to hold public services. Not less
            influential was the work of Sören <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Kierkegaard</span></em> (died 1855), who,
            largely in sympathy with Grundtvig, without ecclesiastical
            office, in his writings earnestly pled for a living subjective
            piety and unweariedly maintained an uncompromising struggle
            against the official Christianity of the secularized clergy. The
            wild, unmeasured Danomania of 1848-1849, during the military
            conflict with Germany, drew opponents together and made them
            friends. Grundtvig declaimed against everything German, and of
            the two factors, which he had formerly regarded as the pivots
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page361">[pg 361]</span><a name=
            "Pg361" id="Pg361" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> on which universal
            history turned, Danism and Lutheranism, he now let go Lutheranism
            as of German origin. He therefore proposed the abrogation of the
            distinctive German-Lutheran confessions, placed the Apostles'
            Creed before and above the Bible and, pressing in a one-sided
            manner the doctrine of baptismal grace, demanded a <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“joyous Christianity,”</span> denied the necessity of
            continued preaching and exercise of repentance, and wished
            especially to introduce into the schools the Norse mythology as
            introductory to the study of Christianity. His adherents wrought
            with the anti-church party for the abolition of the union of
            church and state. The Danish constitutional law of 1849 abolished
            the confessional churches of the state church, and Catholics,
            Reformed, Moravians, and Jews were granted equal civil rights
            with the Lutherans. Since then the Catholic church has made slow
            but steady progress in the country, and the increasing Baptist
            movement was also favoured by a law of the Volkthing of 1857,
            which abolished compulsory baptism, and only required the
            enrolment of all children in the church books of their respective
            districts within the period of one year. Civil marriage had also
            been granted to dissenters in 1851, and in 1868 the peculiar
            institution of <span class="tei tei-q">“electing
            communities”</span> was founded, by means of which twenty
            families from one or more parishes which declare themselves
            dissatisfied with the pastors appointed them, may, without
            leaving the national church, form an independent congregation
            under pastors chosen by themselves and maintained at their own
            cost. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Schleswig-Holstein</span></em> revolution in
            1848, occasioned enormous confusion and disturbance in the
            ecclesiastical conditions of the district. Over a hundred German
            pastors were expelled and forty-six Schleswig parishes deprived
            of the use of the German language in church and school. In 1864
            both provinces were at last by the Austrian and Prussian alliance
            rent from the Danish government, and in consequence of the German
            war of 1866 were incorporated with Prussia.</p>

            "font-style: italic">Sweden.</span></em>—In Sweden there was
            formed in 1803, in opposition to the barren orthodoxy of the
            state church, a religious association which, if not altogether
            free of pietistic narrowness, was yet without any heretical
            doctrinal tendency, and exercised a quiet and wholesome
            influence. From the diligent <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reading</span></em>
            of Scripture and the works of Luther that prevailed among its
            members it obtained the name of <span lang="sv" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="sv"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Läsare</span></span>. The state proceeded
            against its members with fines and imprisonment, according to the
            old conventicle law of 1726, and the mob treated them with
            insults and violence. But in 1842 a fanatical tendency began to
            show itself under the leadership of a peasant, Erich Jansen, who
            induced many <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Readers</span></em>”</span> to quit the
            church and to cast into the fire even Luther's Postils and
            Catechism as quite superfluous alongside of Holy Scripture. They
            mostly emigrated to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page362">[pg
            362]</span><a name="Pg362" id="Pg362" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            America in 1846. The law of the land since 1686 threatened every
            Swede who seceded from the Lutheran state church with
            imprisonment and exile, loss of civil privileges and the right of
            inheritance. As might therefore be supposed the French Marshal
            Bernadotte, who in 1818, under the name of Charles XIV., ascended
            the throne of Sweden, had been previously in 1810 obliged to
            repudiate the Catholic confession. Even in 1857 the Reichstag
            rejected a royal proposal to set aside the Secession as well as
            the Conventicle Act. But in the very next year, the holding of
            conventicles under clerical supervision, and in 1860, the
            secession to other ecclesiastical denominations, were allowed by
            law. The constitution of 1865 still indeed made adherence to the
            Lutheran confession a condition of qualification for a seat in
            either of the chambers. The Reichstag of 1870 at last sanctioned
            the admission of all Christian dissenters and also of Jews to all
            offices of state as well as to the membership of the Reichstag.
            On behalf of dissenters, especially of the numerous Baptists and
            Methodists, the right of civil marriage was granted in 1879. In
            1877, Waldenström, head-master of the Latin school at Gefle,
            without ecclesiastical ordination, began zealously and
            successfully by speech and writings (to secure the widest
            possible circulation of which a joint stock company with large
            capital was formed) to work for the revival of the Christian life
            in the Lutheran national church. He vigorously contended against
            the church doctrine of atonement and justification, repudiating
            the idea of vicarious penal suffering, and broke through all
            church order by allowing the sacrament of the Lord's supper to be
            dispensed by laymen. He thus put himself, with his numerous
            following, directed by lay preachers in their own prayer meetings
            and mission halls, into direct opposition to the church, but by
            the wise forbearance of the ecclesiastical authorities he has not
            yet been formally ejected.<a id="noteref_111" name="noteref_111"

            "font-style: italic">Norway.</span></em>—In Norway, toward the
            end of last century, rationalism was dominant in almost all the
            pulpits, and only a few remnants of Moravian revivalism raised a
            voice against it. But in 1796, a simple unlearned peasant
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Hans
            Nielsen Hauge</span></em>, then in his twenty-fifth year made his
            appearance as a revival preacher, creating a mighty spiritual
            movement that spread among the masses throughout the whole land.
            He had obtained his own religious knowledge from the study of old
            Lutheran practical theology, and arising at a period of
            extraordinary spiritual excitement, <span class="tei tei-q">“his
            call,”</span> as Hase says, <span class="tei tei-q">“to be a
            prophet was like that of the herdsman of Tekoa.”</span> From 1799
            he continued itinerating for five years, persecuted, reproached,
            and calumniated by the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page363">[pg
            363]</span><a name="Pg363" id="Pg363" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            rationalistic clergy, ten times cast into prison, under a law of
            1741, which forbad laymen to preach, and then set free, until he
            had gone over all Norway even to its farthest and remotest
            corners, preaching unweariedly everywhere in houses and in the
            open air often three or four times a day, and nourishing besides
            the flame which he had kindled by voluminous writings and an
            extensive correspondence. He directed his preaching not only
            against the rationalism of the state clergy, but also against the
            antinomian religion of feeling, of <span class="tei tei-q">“Blood
            and Wounds”</span> theology introduced in earlier days by the
            Moravians, with a one-sided emphasis and exaggeration indeed, but
            still in all essentials maintaining the basis and keeping within
            the lines of Lutheran orthodoxy. In 1804 he was charged with
            tendencies dangerous to church and state, obtaining money from
            peasants on false pretences, inciting the people against the
            clergy, etc., and again cast into prison. The trial this time was
            carried on for ten years, until at last in 1814 the supreme court
            sentenced him on account of his invectives against the clergy to
            pay a fine, but pronounced him not guilty on the other charges.
            Broken down in spirit and body by his long imprisonment, he could
            not think of engaging again in his former work. He died in 1824.
            Numerous peasant preachers, however, issuing from his school were
            ready to go forth in his footsteps, and till this day the
            salutary effects of his and their activity are seen in wide
            circles. The law of 1741 which had been made to tell against them
            was at last abrogated by the Storthing in 1842. In 1845 the right
            of forming Christian sects was recognised, and in 1851 even the
            Jews were allowed the right of settlement previously refused
            them, and the security of all civil privileges. Since that time
            even in Norway the Catholic church has made considerable
            progress; in June, 1878, it had eleven churches and fourteen
            priests.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">During the
            course of the century a breach from without was made upon the
            stronghold of the Anglican established church and its legal
            standing throughout the United Kingdom. The strong coherence of
            the Anglican episcopal church had already been weakened
            internally by the rise within its own bosom of High, Low, and
            Broad tendencies. The advance of the first-named party to
            tractarianism and ritualism opened the door to Romish sympathies,
            while in the last-named school German rationalism and criticism
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page364">[pg 364]</span><a name=
            "Pg364" id="Pg364" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> found favour, and
            the low church party was not ashamed to go hand-in-hand with the
            evangelical pietistic and methodistic tendencies of the
            dissenters. There followed numerous conversions to Rome,
            especially from the aristocratic ranks of the upper ten thousand.
            The Emancipation Act of 1829 opened the door to both Houses of
            Parliament to the Catholics, and in 1858 the same privileges were
            extended to the Jews. Also the bulwarks which the state church
            had in the old universities of Oxford and Cambridge were
            undermined, and in 1871 were completely overthrown by the legal
            abolition of all confessional tests. Down to 1869 the hierarchy
            of the episcopal state church, though clearly alien to the
            country, maintained its legal position in Catholic Ireland, till
            at last the Irish Church Bill brought it there to an end.
            Repeatedly have bills been introduced in the House of Commons,
            though hitherto without success, by members of the incessantly
            agitating Liberation Society, to disestablish the churches of
            England, Scotland, and Wales.<a id="noteref_112" name=

            the aristocracy, holds aloof from the dissenters, seeks to
            maintain the closest connexion between church and state, and
            eagerly contends for the retention of all old ecclesiastical
            forms and ordinances in constitution, worship, and doctrine. On

            which is more or less methodistically inclined, holds free
            intercourse with dissenters, associating with them in home and
            foreign mission work, etc., and with various shades of

            "Pg365" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in 1871, occasioned by the
            Oxford <span class="tei tei-q">“Essays and Reviews”</span> and
            the works of Bishop Colenso, which resulted in the publication,
            under the authority of the bishops, of the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Speaker's Commentary,”</span> so-called because
            suggested by Denison, who had long been speaker of the House of
            Commons. It is a learned, thoroughly conservative commentary on
            the whole Bible by the ablest theologians of England. On the
            revision of the English translation of the Bible see <a href=

            these two parties, however, there has arisen a third, the broad
            church party. It originated with the distinguished poet and
            philosopher, Coleridge (died 1834), and includes many of the most
            excellent and scholarly of the clergy, especially those most
            eminent for their acquaintance with German theology and
            philosophy. They do not form an organized ecclesiastical party
            like the evangelicals and high church men, but endeavour not only
            to overcome the narrowness and severity of the former, but also
            to secure a broader basis and a wider horizon for theology as
            well as for the church.<a id="noteref_113" name="noteref_113"

            struggle for the legalizing of marriage with a deceased wife's
            sister has been energetically pressed since 1850, but though the
            House of Commons has repeatedly passed the bill, it has been
            hitherto by small majorities, under the influence of the bishops,
            rejected by the House of Lords.—A non-official <em class=

            pre-eminently anti-Romish and anti-ritualistic tendencies, was
            held in London in 1867 (cf. <a href="#Section_175_Para_5" class=

            it was attended by nearly one hundred bishops, one of them a
            negro. Of the three weeks' debates and their results, however, no
            detailed account has been published.</p>

            "font-style: italic">The Tractarians and
            Ritualists.</span></em>—The activity of the dissenters and the
            episcopal evangelical party's attachment to them stirred up the
            adherents of the high church party to vigorous guarding of their
            interests, and drove them into a one-sided exaggerated
            accentuation of the Catholic element. The centre of this movement
            since 1833 was the university of Oxford. Its leaders were
            Professors Pusey and Newman, its literary organ the <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Tracts for the
            Times</span></em>, from which the party received the name of
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Tractarians</span></em>. This was a series
            of ninety treatises, published 1833-1841, on the basis of
            Anglo-Catholicism, which sought, while holding by the Thirty-nine
            Articles, to affirm with equal decidedness the genuine
            Protestantism over against the Roman papacy, and, in the
            importance which it attached to the apostolical succession of the
            episcopate and priesthood and the apostolical tradition
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page366">[pg 366]</span><a name=
            "Pg366" id="Pg366" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> for the
            interpretation of Scripture, the genuine Catholicism over against
            every form of ultra-Protestantism. In this way, too, their
            dogmatics in all the several doctrines, as far as the Thirty-nine
            Articles would by any means allow, was approximated to the Roman
            Catholic doctrine, and indeed by-and-by passed over entirely to
            that type of doctrine. Newman's Tract 90 caused most offence, in
            which, with thoroughly jesuitical sophistry, it was argued that
            the Thirty-nine Articles were capable of an explanation on the
            basis of which they might be subscribed even by one who occupied
            in regard to the church doctrine and practice an essentially
            Roman Catholic standpoint. The university authorities now felt
            obliged to declare publicly that the tracts were by no means
            sanctioned by them, and that especially the application of the
            principles of Tract 90 to the conduct of students in the matter
            of subscription of the Thirty-nine Articles is not allowable.
            Bishop Bagot of Oxford, hitherto favourable to the tractarians,
            refused to permit the continued issue of the tracts. The other
            bishops also for the most part spoke against them in their
            pastorals, and a flood of controversial pamphlets roused the
            wrath of the non-Catholic populace. But on the other hand
            tractarianism still found favour among the higher clergy and the
            aristocracy. In 1845 Newman went over to the Catholic church, and
            has since led a retired life devoted to theological study. Pius
            IX. paid him no attention, but in 1879 Leo XIII. acknowledged and
            rewarded his services to the Catholic church by elevating him to
            the rank of cardinal. The majority of the tractarians disapproved
            of Newman's step and remained in the Anglican church. Thus acted
            Pusey (died 1882), the recognised leader of the party, after whom
            they were now called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Puseyites</span></em>. Many, however,
            followed Newman's example, so that by the end of 1846 no less
            than one hundred and fifty clergymen and prominent laymen were
            received into the widely opened door of the Catholic
            church.<a id="noteref_114" name="noteref_114" href=

            following twelve years, 1846-1858, were occupied by two
            dogmatico-ecclesiastical conflicts vitally affecting the
            interests of the tractarians. (1) <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">The Gorham
            Case.</span></em> The Thirty-nine Articles took essentially
            Lutheran ground in treating of baptism, recognising it as a
            vehicle of regeneration and divine sonship, and the tractarians
            laid uncommonly great stress upon this article. So also the
            Bishop of Exeter, Dr. Philpotts, refused to institute the Rev.
            Cornelius Gorham because of his views on this subject. Gorham
            accused him before the Archbishop of Canterbury, but the Court of
            Arches decided in favour of the bishop. The Court of Appeal,
            however, the judicial committee of the Privy Council, annulled
            the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page367">[pg 367]</span><a name=
            "Pg367" id="Pg367" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> episcopal
            judgment, and ordered that Gorham should be installed in his
            office. In vain did Philpotts, by a protest before the Court of
            Queen's Bench, and then before the Court of Common Pleas, against
            the jurisdiction of the Privy Council in this case, in vain, too,
            did Blomfield, Bishop of London, insist upon the revival of
            Convocation, which for one and a half centuries had been
            inoperative as a spiritual parliament with upper and lower
            houses, and in vain did a tractarian assembly of more than 1,500
            distinguished clergymen and laymen lodge a solemn protest. The
            judgment of the Privy Council stood, and Gorham was inducted to
            his office in 1850. Many of the protesters now went over to the
            Catholic church, and about 600 others, like the Puritan Pilgrim
            Fathers 230 years before (§ 143, 4), under ecclesiastical
            oppression, emigrated to New Zealand.—(2) <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">The Denison
            Eucharist Case.</span></em>—The Puseyite Archdeacon Denison of
            Taunton, in the diocese of Bath and Wells, had in 1851 in open
            defiance of the Thirty-nine Articles, which represent Calvin's
            views of the Lord's Supper, affirmed in preaching and writing
            that unbelievers as well as believers eat and drink the body and
            blood of the Lord. Over this he was involved in a sharp
            discussion with a neighbouring clergyman called Ditcher. In 1854
            Ditcher accused Denison before his bishop, who, after vain
            efforts to reconcile the parties, referred the matter to the
            Court of Arches, which sought, but in vain, to end the strife by
            compromise. Ditcher now in 1856 brought his complaint before the
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Queen's
            Bench</span></em>, which obliged the archbishop to take up the
            matter again. A commission appointed by him declared that the
            complaint was quite justifiable, and threatened Denison, when he
            refused any sort of retraction, with deposition. But the Court of
            Appeal in 1858 stayed the judgment on the ground of a technical
            error in procedure, and Denison remained in office.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><a name=

            "tei tei-anchor"></a> 3. From the middle of 1850 the tractarians,
            who had hitherto confined themselves to the development of the
            Romanizing system of doctrine, began to apply its consequences to
            the church ritual and the Christian life, and so won for
            themselves the name of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Ritualists</span></em>, which has driven out
            their earlier designation. Wherever possible they showed their
            Catholic zeal by introducing images, crucifixes, candles, holy
            water, mass dresses, mass bells, and boy choristers, urged the
            restoration of the seven sacraments, especially of extreme
            unction, auricular confession, the sacrificial theory and Corpus
            Christi day, of prayers for the dead and masses for souls,
            invocation of saints and the blessed Virgin; they also praised
            celibacy and monasticism, etc. Ritualism has from the first shown
            singular skill in party organization. The <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">English Church
            Union</span></em>, founded in 1860, has now nearly 200,000
            members, of these about 3,000 clergymen and 50 bishops, and it
            embraces 300 branches over the whole domain of <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page368">[pg 368]</span><a name="Pg368" id=
            "Pg368" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the Anglican church. Numerous
            brotherhoods and sisterhoods, guilds and orders, organized after
            the style of Roman Catholic monasticism, promote the interests of
            ritualism, and zealously prosecute home and foreign mission work.
            The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Confraternity of the Blessed
            Sacrament</span></em> originated in 1862, was able in 1882 to
            celebrate Corpus Christi day in 250 churches along with the
            Romish church, dispensing only with the procession. The
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Society
            of the Holy Cross</span></em>, founded in 1873 consists only of
            priests, and forms a kind of directory for all branches of the
            ritualistic propaganda. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">English Order of St. Augustine</span></em>
            has a threefold division, into spiritual brothers who are
            preparing for priests' orders, lay brothers who are being
            qualified as lay preachers, both under the strictest vows, and a
            sort of tertiaries, who are free from vows. Among the sisterhoods
            which already supply nurses to all the great hospitals of the
            capital, the most important is that called <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“by the name of Jesus.”</span> They take, like the
            Beguines of the middle ages, the three vows, but not as binding
            for life. By the ultra high church party the genuine apostolic
            succession of the ordination of the first Protestant archbishop,
            Matthew Parker, and so the genuineness of all subsequent
            ordinations going back to him, were doubted; three Anglican
            bishops are said to have had episcopal consecration anew
            conferred on them by a Greek Catholic bishop. The reckless and
            wilful procedure of the ritualists in imitating the Roman
            Catholic ritual in public worship called forth frequent violent
            disturbances at their services, and noisy crowds flocked to their
            churches. Most frequent and violent were the riots in 1859 and
            1860 in the parish of St. George's, London, where scarcely any
            service was held without disgraceful scenes of hissing,
            whistling, stamping, and cries of <span class="tei tei-q">“No
            popery.”</span> The offscouring of all London flocked to the
            Sunday services as to a public entertainment. Instead of hymns,
            street songs were sung, instead of responses blasphemous cries
            were shouted forth, while cushions and prayer-books were hurled
            at the altar decorations, etc. These unseemly proceedings were
            caused by the ritualistic rector, Bryan King, who had introduced
            the objectionable ceremonial, and obstinately continued it in
            spite of the decided opposition and protests of his colleague,
            Mr. Allen. King's removal in 1860 first put an end to these
            disturbances, which police interference proved utterly unable to
            check. The ritualistic <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Church Union</span></em>, called into
            existence by these proceedings, was opposed by an
            anti-ritualistic <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Church Association</span></em>, and from
            both multitudes of complaints and appeals were brought before the
            ecclesiastical and civil tribunals. The first case they brought
            up was that of Rev. A. H. MacConochie, of Holborn, who, having
            been admonished by the ecclesiastical courts on account of his
            ritualistic practices in 1867, appealed to the Privy Council. And
            although this court decided in 1869 that all ceremonies not
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page369">[pg 369]</span><a name=
            "Pg369" id="Pg369" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> authorized by the
            prayer-book are to be regarded as forbidden, he and his followers
            continued to act on the principle that whatever is not there
            expressly prohibited ought to be permitted. The <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Public Worship
            Regulation Bill</span></em>, introduced by Archbishop Tait, and
            passed by Parliament, which legislatively determined the
            procedure in ritualistic cases, did not prevent the constant
            advance of this movement. The <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Court of
            Arches</span></em> now issued a suspension against the accused,
            and condemned them to prison when they continued to officiate,
            until they declared themselves ready to obey or to demit their
            office. Tooth of Hatcham, Dale of London, Enraght of Bordesdale,
            and Green of Miles Platting were actually sent to prison in 1880.
            But the first three were soon liberated by the Court of Appeal
            finding some technical flaw in the proceedings against them,
            while Green, in whose case no such flaw appeared, lay in
            confinement for twenty months. The ritualists still persistently
            continued their practice, and their opponents renewed their
            prosecutions; these were followed by appeals to the higher
            courts, presenting of petitions to both the Houses of Parliament,
            addresses with vast numbers of signatures for and against to the
            Archbishop of Canterbury, to Convocation which had meanwhile been
            restored, to the Cabinet, to the Queen, etc. The result was that
            many cases were abandoned, some obnoxious parties transferred
            elsewhere, and a very few deposed.</p>

            Church.</span></em>—The more liberal tendency of the broad church
            party had also many supporters who scrupled not to pass beyond
            the traditional bounds of English orthodoxy. In opposition to the
            orthodoxy zealousy inculcated at Oxford, rationalism found favour
            at the rival university of Cambridge, and vigorous support was
            given to the views of the Tübingen school of Baur in the London
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Westminster Review</span></em>. And even in
            high church Oxford, there were not wanting teachers in sympathy
            with the critical and speculative rationalism of Germany. Great
            excitement was caused in 1860 by the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Essays and Reviews</span></em>,”</span>
            which in seven treatises by so many Oxford professors contested
            the traditional apologetics and hermeneutics of English theology,
            and set a sublimated rationalism in its place. In Germany these
            not very important treatises would probably have excited little
            remark, but in the English church they roused an unparalleled
            disturbance; more than nine thousand clergymen of the episcopal
            church protested against the book, and all the bishops
            unanimously condemned it. The excitement had not yet subsided
            when from South Africa oil was poured upon the flames. Bishop
            Colenso of Natal (died 1883), who had zealously carried on the
            mission there, but had openly expressed the conviction that it is
            unwise, unscriptural, and unchristian to make repudiation by
            Caffres living in polygamy, of all their wives but one, a
            condition of baptism, had <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            "tei tei-anchor"></a> occasioned still greater offence by
            publishing in 1863 in seven vols. a prolix critical disquisition
            on the Pentateuch and the Book of Joshua, in which he contested
            the authenticity and unconditional credibility of these books by
            arguments familiar long ago but now quite antiquated and
            overthrown in Germany. During a journey to England undertaken for
            his defence he was excommunicated and deposed by a synod of the
            South African bishops in Capetown. The Privy Council, as supreme
            ecclesiastical court in England, cleared him, as well as the

            aid for the dissemination of liberal religious views is afforded
            by the Hibbert Lectureship. Robert Hibbert (died 1849), a wealthy
            private gentleman in London, assigned the yearly interest of a
            considerable sum for <span class="tei tei-q">“the spreading of
            Christianity in its simplest form as well as the furthering of
            the unfettered exercise of the individual judgment in matters of
            religion.”</span> The Hibbert trustees are eighteen laymen who
            dispense the revenues in supplementing the salaries of poorly
            paid clergymen of liberal views, in providing bursaries for
            theological students at home and abroad, and in other such like
            ways, but since 1878 especially, by advice of distinguished
            scholars, in the endowment of annual courses of lectures,
            afterwards published, on subjects in the domain of philosophy,
            biblical criticism, the comparative science of religion and the
            history of religion. The first Hibbert Lecturer was the
            celebrated Oxford professor, Max Müller, in 1878. Among other
            lecturers may be named Renan of Paris in 1880; Kuenen of Leyden
            in 1882; Pfleiderer of Berlin, in 1885. The battle waged with
            great passionateness on both sides since 1869 for and against the
            removal of the Athanasian Creed, or at least its anathemas, from
            the liturgy has not yet been brought to any decided result.</p>

            England.</span></em>—Down nearly to the end of the eighteenth
            century all the enactments and restrictions of the Toleration Act
            of 1689 (<a href="#Section_155_Para_3" class="tei tei-ref">§ 155,
            3</a>) continued in full force. But in 1779 the obligation of
            Protestant dissenters to subscribe the Thirty-nine Articles was
            abolished, and the acknowledgment of the Bible as God's revealed
            word substituted. The right of founding schools of their own,
            hitherto denied them, was granted in 1798. In 1813 the Socinians
            were also included among the dissenters who should enjoy these
            privileges. After a severe struggle the <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Corporation and
            Test Acts</span></em> were set aside in 1826, affording all
            dissenters entrance to Parliament and to all civil offices. The
            necessity of being married and having their children baptized in
            an episcopal church was removed by the Marriage and Registration
            Act of 1836 and 1837, and divorce suits were removed from the
            ecclesiastical to a civil tribunal in 1857. In 1868 compulsory
            church rates for the episcopal parish church were abolished. Lord
            Russell's University Bill of 1854, by restricting subscription
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page371">[pg 371]</span><a name=
            "Pg371" id="Pg371" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of the Thirty-nine
            Articles to the theological students, opened the universities of
            Oxford and Cambridge to dissenters, while the University Tests
            Bill of 1871 made the adherents of all religious confessions
            eligible for all university honours and emoluments at both
            seminaries. Thus one restriction after another was removed, so
            that at last the episcopal church has nothing of her exclusive
            privileges left beyond the rank and title of a state church, and
            the undiminished possession of all her ancient property, from
            which her prelates draw princely revenues.</p>

            "font-style: italic">Scotch Marriages in England.</span></em>—The
            saints of the English Revolution had indeed resolved in 1653 to
            introduce civil marriage (<a href="#Section_162_Para_1" class=
            "tei tei-ref">§ 162, 1</a>). But the reaction under Cromwell set
            this unpopular law aside, and the Restoration made marriage by an
            Anglican clergyman, even for dissenters, an indispensable
            condition of legal recognition. But in no country, especially
            among the higher orders, were private marriages, without the
            knowledge and consent of the family, so frequent as here, and
            clergymen were always to be found unscrupulous enough to
            celebrate such weddings in taverns or other convenient places.
            When an end had been put to such irregularities on English soil
            by an Act of Parliament of 1753, lovers seeking secret marriage
            betook themselves to Scotland. In that country there prevailed,
            and still prevails, the theory that a declaration of willingness
            on both sides constitutes a perfectly valid marriage. The
            Scottish ecclesiastical law indeed requires church proclamation
            and ceremony, but failure to observe this requirement is followed
            only by a small pecuniary fine. Fugitive English couples
            generally made the necessary declaration before a blacksmith at
            Gretna-Green, who was also justice of the peace in this small
            border village, and were then legitimately married people
            according to Scottish law. Only in 1856 were all marriages
            performed in this manner without previous residence in Scotland
            pronounced by Act of Parliament invalid.</p>

            Presbyterian Church of Scotland, from the beginning strictly
            Calvinistic in constitution, doctrine and practice, has,

            times has the endeavour of the so-called <em class=

            Presbyterian Church</span></em>, which now embraces one-fifth of
            the population.—Twice that number joined the secession of the
            Free Church in 1843. The General Assembly of the Church of
            Scotland granted to congregations in 1834 the right of vetoing
            presentations to vacancies. The civil courts, however, upheld the
            absolute right of patrons, and at the Assembly of 1843 about two
            hundred of the most distinguished ministers, with the great Dr.
            Chalmers (died 1847) at their head, left the state church, and,
            as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Free
            Church of Scotland</span></em>, which at its own cost formed new
            parishes and distinguished itself by Christian zeal in every
            direction. It differs from the <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">United
            Presbyterian Church</span></em> in restricting its opposition to
            the abuse of patronage, without repudiating right off every sort
            of state aid and endowment as unevangelical. But even to it the
            law passed in 1846, granting to all congregations the right of
            veto, seemed now no longer a sufficient motive to return to the
            state church. Even when in 1874, parliament, at the call of the
            government, formally abolished the rights of patronage through
            all Scotland and gave to the congregations the right of choosing
            their own ministers, the General Assembly of the Free Church by a
            great majority refused to reunite with the state church brought
            so near it, because it conceded to the civil courts unwarrantable
            interference with its internal affairs, especially the right of
            suspending its clergy.<a id="noteref_115" name="noteref_115"

            Christ's intervention, would not suffer eternal <span class=

            and that the same fate still lay before unbelievers and the
            impenitent. After five days' violent discussion, the majority of
            the synod, while strongly dissenting from his views and urging
            him to avoid it in his preaching and catechising, resolved to
            retain him in office as having proved his adherence to the
            orthodox doctrine of the atonement. But when, at next year's
            synod, the Rev. D. Macrae of Gourock asserted that, in spite of
            the Westminster Confession, it was allowable for ministers to
            deny the eternity of punishment, and would not promise to preach
            otherwise, he was unanimously deposed.—Far more exciting and long
            continued were the proceedings begun in the Free Church in 1876,
            against Professor Robertson Smith of Aberdeen, who was charged
            before his presbytery with offensive statements about angels, but
            especially with contradicting the inspiration of Scripture by
            contesting the Mosaic authorship of Deuteronomy. After various
            proposals of deposition, suspension, rebuke, acquittal, had been
            made, the General Assembly of 1880, after much deliberation and
            discussion, by a majority found the charge of heterodoxy not
            proven, but earnestly exhorted the accused to greater
            circumspection and moderation, and the decision was greeted with
            thundering applause from the students and waving of handkerchiefs
            from the ladies present. But when, very soon after this
            acquittal, several other contributions by him appeared in the
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            "font-style: italic">Commission</span></em> sitting in Edinburgh
            reinstituted proceedings against him. In October, 1880, Smith
            vindicated before that court his scientific attitude toward the
            Old Testament, maintaining that a moderate criticism of the
            biblical books was reconcilable with the maintenance of their
            inspired authority. The majority of the Commission, however,
            voted for his expulsion from his chair. Smith protested both
            against the competence and against the judgment of the
            Commission, but declared himself ready to submit to the judgment
            of the General Assembly. Meanwhile he accepted an invitation from
            Glasgow to deliver public lectures there on the Old Testament,
            which were received with extraordinary favour. This course was
            published under the title: <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class=

            May, 1881, now decided by a large majority to remove him from his
            academical chair, with retention of his license and his
            professor's salary, which latter, however, Smith declined. But
            his numerous sympathizers presented him with a scientific library
            worth £3,000, and promised an annual stipend equal to his former
            salary. In 1883 he received the appointment as Professor of

            "font-style: italic">The Catholic Church in
            Ireland.</span></em>—The Catholic inhabitants of Ireland under
            Protestant proprietors, and forced to pay tithes for the support
            of the Protestant clergy, were always deprived of civil rights.
            In 1809 O'Connell (died 1847), an agitator of great popular
            eloquence, placed himself at the head of the oppressed people, in
            order in a constitutional way to secure religious and political
            freedom and equality. At last, in 1829, the Emancipation Bill,
            supported by Peel and Wellington, was passed, which on the basis
            of the formal declaration of the whole Catholic episcopate that
            papal infallibility and papal sovereignty in civil matters was
            not part of the Catholic faith nor could be joined therewith
            either in Ireland or anywhere else in the Catholic world, gave to
            Catholics admission to parliament and to all civil and military
            appointments. But the hated tithes remained, and were enforced,
            when refused, by military force. After long debates in both
            houses of parliament, the Tithes Bill was adopted in 1838, which
            transferred the tithe as a land-tax from tenants to proprietors,
            which, however, was only a postponing of the question. It was
            thus regarded by O'Connell. He declared that justice for Ireland
            could only be got by abolishing the legislative union with Great
            Britain existing since 1800, and restoring her independent
            parliament. For this purpose he organized the Repeal Association.
            In 1840 another no less powerful popular agitator arose in the
            person of the Irish Capuchin, Father Mathew, the apostle of
            temperance, who with unparalleled success persuaded thousands of
            those degraded by drink to take vows of abstinence from
            spirituous liquors. He kept apart from all political agitation,
            but the fruits of his exertions were all in its favour. O'Connell
            in 1843 organized monster meetings, attended by hundreds of
            thousands. The government had him tried, the jury found him
            guilty, but the House of Lords quashed the conviction and
            liberated him from prison in 1844. The Peel ministry now sought
            to soothe the excitement by passing in 1845 the Legacy Act, which
            allowed Catholics to hold property in their own names, and the
            Maynooth Bill, by which the theological seminary at Maynooth
            received a rich endowment from the State. Continued famine, and
            consequent emigration of several hundreds of thousands to America
            and Australia, relieved Ireland of a considerable portion of its
            Catholic population, while Protestant missions <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page375">[pg 375]</span><a name="Pg375" id=
            "Pg375" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> by Bible and tract
            circulation and by schools had some success in evangelizing those
            who remained. On November 5th, 1855, the anniversary of the
            Gunpowder Plot, the Redemptorists at Kingstown, near Dublin,
            erected and burnt a great bonfire in the public streets of Bibles
            which they had seized, and the primate archbishop of Ireland
            justified it by reference to the example of the believers at
            Ephesus (Acts xix. 19).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><a name=

            the American Irish, which since 1863 created such terror among
            the English, was the result of political rather than religious
            agitation. Although this movement failed in its proper end,
            namely the complete separation of Ireland from England, it yet
            forced upon the government the conviction of the absolute
            necessity of meeting the just demands of the Irish by
            thorough-going reforms and putting an end to the oppressions
            which the native farmers suffered at the hands of foreign
            landowners, and the grievances endured by the Catholic church by
            the maintenance of the Anglican church established in Ireland.
            The carrying out of these reforms was the service rendered by the
            Gladstone ministry. By the Irish Land Bill of 1870 the land
            question was solved according to the demands of justice, and by
            the Irish Church Bill of 1869, which deprived the Anglican church
            in Ireland of the character of a state church and put it on the
            same footing as other denominations, the church question was
            similarly settled. The dignitaries of the Anglican church thus
            lost their position as state officials and their seats in the
            House of Lords. The rich property of the hitherto established
            church was calculated and applied partly to compensating for
            losses caused by this reform, partly to creating benevolent
            institutions for the general good. But neither the Church Bill,
            nor the Land Bill, nor the Universities Bill, which in 1880
            founded by state aid a Catholic university in Dublin, secured the
            reconciliation of the Irish. <span class="tei tei-q">“Eternal
            hatred of England”</span> was and is the battle cry; <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Ireland for the Irish, and only for them,”</span> is
            their watchword. In order to carry out this scheme an Irish
            <span class="tei tei-q">“National League”</span> was formed, and
            innumerable secret <span class="tei tei-q">“Moonlighters,”</span>
            under the supposed leadership of <span class="tei tei-q">“Captain
            Moonshine,”</span> committed atrocities by burning farm steadings
            and mutilating cattle, murdering and massacring by dagger and
            revolver, petroleum and dynamite, and directed their operations
            against the representatives of the government, against
            proprietors who sought rent, against tenants who paid rent,
            against officials who endeavoured to enforce it, and against
            everything that was, or was called, English. In order to cut at
            the root of this lawlessness, which by proclamation of a state of
            siege was only restricted, not overthrown, the government of 1881
            passed further agrarian reforms: All tenant rights were to be
            purchased <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page376">[pg
            376]</span><a name="Pg376" id="Pg376" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            by the surplus of the fund formed by the disestablishment of the
            Irish church, and where this did not suffice, by state grants,
            and the right to conclude contracts for rent and to determine its
            amount was transferred from the proprietors to a
            newly-constituted land court, without whose permission, after the
            lapse of the fifteen years' term, no rent contract could be made.
            But even this did not stop almost daily repeated murders and acts
            of destruction. The government now sought the aid of the pope
            through the mediation of a Catholic member of parliament on a
            visit to Rome; but these merely confidential negotiations led to
            no considerable result. In May, 1883, the curia, on the occasion
            of a collection promoted by the National League as a magnificent
            national present to the great (Protestant) leader of the
            agitation, Mr. Parnell, in a circular letter, forbad <span class=

            taking any part in the movement, and urged them to dissuade their
            members from doing so. But only Archbishop McCabe of Dublin (died
            1885), from the first an opponent of the League, issued a
            pastoral against it to be read in all the pulpits of his diocese.
            The other bishops ignored the papal command, and among the
            Catholic people the opinion obtained that they owed to the pope
            obedience in spiritual but not in political matters. The
            collections for the Parnell fund were continued with redoubled
            zeal. The attempts of dynamitards, supplied with materials by
            their American compatriots, and other agrarian offences have not
            yet been finally stopped.</p>

            relief of the Irish, naturally also benefited English Catholics,
            who in 1791 had been allowed to hold Catholic services. Led by
            the numerous accessions of Puseyites to entertain the most
            extravagant hopes, Pius IX. in 1850 issued a bull, by which the
            Roman Catholic hierarchy in England was reinstituted with twelve
            suffragan bishoprics under one archbishop of Westminster. The
            bull occasioned great excitement in the Protestant population
            (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Anti-Papal Aggression</span></em>), and the
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Ecclesiastical Titles Bill</span></em>
            forbade the use of ecclesiastical titles not sanctioned by the
            law of the land. After the first excitement had passed, the
            Catholic bishops, at their head the learned and brilliant and
            zealous ultramontane Cardinal Archbishop Wiseman (died 1865), and
            his successor, surpassing him, if not in genius and learning, at
            least in ultramontane zeal, the Puseyite convert Manning, made a
            cardinal in 1875, used with impunity their condemned titles,
            until in 1871 the Ecclesiastical Titles Bill was formally revoked
            by act of parliament. Conversions in noble families were
            particularly numerous in the later decades. Since 1850 the number
            of Catholics in England and Scotland has quadrupled. This has
            been caused in great part by Irish emigration, <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page377">[pg 377]</span><a name="Pg377" id=
            "Pg377" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> for the middle and lower
            ranks of the English have scarcely been affected by the
            conversion fever, which as the latest form of the fitful humour
            of the English had so rich a harvest in the families of the
            nobility. In 1780 all London had only one Catholic place of
            worship, the chapel of the Sardinian embassy, which on June 2nd
            of that year was wrecked and burnt by a raging mob. Now the
            English capital has two episcopal dioceses, ninety-four Catholic
            churches and chapels (besides about 900 Anglican churches) with
            313 clergymen, and forty-four cloisters. In the House of Lords
            sit twenty-eight Roman Catholic peers, and in both countries
            there are forty-seven Catholic baronets. Since 1847 England has a
            specifically Catholic university at Kensington, under the
            episcopate, and with the pope as its supreme head, which,
            however, with its poor staff of teachers and its expensive course
            attracts but a few of the Catholic youth of England. Since the
            Anti-Papal Aggression of 1850 failed, the Protestant people have
            shown themselves comparatively indifferent to such assumptions of
            the papacy.—In the Act of Union of 1707 (<a href=
            "#Section_155_Para_3" class="tei tei-ref">§ 155, 3</a>),
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Scotland</span></em> was guaranteed the
            absolute exclusion of every sort of Roman Catholic hierarchy for
            all time to come. But in recent times the number of its Catholic
            inhabitants so greatly increased, that Pius IX. in his last
            years, not unaided by the English government, eagerly urged the
            re-establishment of the hierarchy, and Leo XIII. was able at his
            first consistory of the college of cardinals in March, 1878, to
            make appointments to the two newly-erected archdioceses and their
            bishoprics. On the following Easter Sunday the allocution
            relating thereto was read in all Catholic churches in Scotland.
            The restoration was thus carried out in spite of all protests and
            demonstrations of Scottish Protestants.</p>

            emigration has led to the formation of a considerable number of
            German Lutheran congregations, which are distributed in three
            synods. 1. The Victoria Synod was founded in 1852 by pastor
            Göthe. It adopted at first the union platform, but subsequently
            attached itself more decidedly to the Lutheran confession. 2.
            Pastor Karch, who in 1830 emigrated with a number of Prussian
            Lutherans, in order to avoid the union, laid the foundation of
            the Immanuel Synod. Since 1875 it has been supplied with
            preachers from the missionary institute of Neuendettelsau. It is
            distinguished by its missionary zeal for the conversion of the
            natives, pursues with special interest the study of the prophetic
            word, and makes chiliasm an open question which need not rend the
            church. 3. The South Australian Synod, on the other hand, is the
            decided opponent of any sort of chiliasm, and has assumed an
            attitude of violent antagonism to the Immanuel Synod.</p>

            and vigour out of all the political convulsions which have since

            Reformed church the opposition of methodistically tinctured
            orthodoxy, reinforced from England and French Switzerland, and
            rationalistic freethinking, led to sharp conflicts. Also in the
            Lutheran church, more strongly influenced by Germany, similar
            discussions arose, but a more conciliatory spirit prevailed and

            to the idea of a wholesome internal reform of the French Church:
            Catholicism is the acknowledged religion of the majority of the
            French people; the church property belongs to the state, with the
            obligation to maintain the clergy and ordinances; the clergy who
            had taken the oath and those who were expatriated were all to
            resign, but were eligible for election; new boundaries were to be
            marked out for the episcopal dioceses with reference to the
            political divisions of the country; the government elects and the
            pope confirms the bishops, and these, with approval of the
            government, appoint the priests. The one-sided <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Organic
            Articles</span></em> of the first Consul of 1802, which were
            annexed to the publication of the Concordat as a code of
            explanatory regulations, made any proclamation of papal orders
            and decrees of all foreign councils dependent on previous
            permission of the government, as also the calling of synods and
            consultative assemblies of the clergy. They further ordained that
            all official services of the clergy should be gratuitous, and
            transferred to the civil council the right and duty of strict
            inquiry into any clerical breach of civil laws and any misuse or
            excessive exercise of clerical authority. The thirty-first
            article, however, created that unhappy order of <span lang="fr"

            result of which was that interim appointments were made to most
            of the benefices in order to squeeze state pay in supplement to
            the inadequate ecclesiastical endowments, and so their holders
            were at the absolute mercy of the bishops who could transport or
            dispense with them at any moment. For further particulars about
            the friendly and hostile relations of Napoleon and the pope, see

            By an imperial decree of 1810, the four articles of the Gallican
            Church (<a href="#Section_156_Para_3" class="tei tei-ref">§ 156,
            3</a>) were made laws of the Empire; and a French National
            Council of 1811 sought to complete the reconstruction of the
            church according to Napoleon's ideas, but proved utterly
            incapable for such a task, and was therefore dissolved by the
            emperor himself.—To pacify the Protestants, dissatisfied with the
            Concordat, amid flattering acknowledgment of their services to
            the state, to science and to the arts, an appendix was attached
            to the Organic Articles, securing to them liberty of religious
            worship and political and municipal equality with Catholics. For
            training ministers for the Reformed Church a theological seminary
            was founded at Montauban, and for Lutherans an academy with a
            seminary at Strassburg. Napoleon also afterwards proved himself
            on every occasion ready to help the Protestants. He was equally
            forward in recognising public opinion in France. The National
            Institute of France in 1804 offered a prize for an essay on the
            influence of Luther's Reformation on the formation and advance of
            European national life, and awarded it to the treatise of the
            Catholic physician <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page380">[pg

            Restoration under Louis XVIII. (1814-1824) and Charles X.
            (1824-1830) made Catholicism the state religion and granted
            toleration and state protection to the other confessions. A new
            concordat concluded with Pius VII. in 1817, by which that of
            Napoleon of 1801, with the Organic Articles of the following
            year, were abrogated, and the state of matters previous to 1789
            restored, was so vigorously opposed by the nation, that the
            ministry were obliged to withdraw the measure introduced in both
            chambers for giving it legislative sanction. Ultramontanism,
            however, in its boldest form, steadily favoured by the
            government, soon prevailed among the clergy to such an extent
            that any inclination to Gallicanism was denounced as heresy and
            intolerance of Protestantism lauded as piety. In southern France
            the rekindled hatred of the Catholic mob against the Reformed
            broke out in 1815 in brutal and bloody persecution. The
            government kept silence till the indignation of Europe obliged it
            to put down the atrocities, but the offenders were left
            unpunished. Connivance in such lawlessness on the part of the
            government contributed largely to its overthrow in the July
            revolution of 1830. The Catholic Church then lost again the
            privilege of a state religion, and the hitherto persecuted and
            oppressed Protestants obtained equal rights with the Catholics.
            But even under the new constitutional government of Orleans,
            ultramontanism soon reasserted itself. The Protestants had to
            complain of much injury and injustice from Catholic prefects, and
            the Protestant minister Guizot claimed for France the
            protectorate of the whole Catholic world. The Reformed Church
            meanwhile flourished, though vacillating between methodistic
            narrowness and rationalistic shallowness, growing both inwardly
            and outwardly, and also the Lutheran communities, which outside
            of Alsace were only thinly scattered, enjoyed great prosperity.
            In the February revolution of 1848 the Catholic clergy readily
            yielded obedience to the citizen king Louis Philippe, and, on the
            ground that the Catholic church is suited to any form of
            government which only <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page381">[pg

            III.</span></em>—Louis Napoleon, as president of the new republic
            (1848-1852), and still more decidedly as emperor (1852-1870),
            inclined to follow the traditions of his uncle, regarded the
            concordat of 1801 as still legally in force and seemed specially
            anxious to arouse zeal for the Gallican liberties. Although his
            bayonets secured the pope's return to Rome (<a href=
            "#Section_185_Para_2" class="tei tei-ref">§ 185, 2</a>) and even
            afterwards supported his authority there, he did not fulfil the
            heart's wish of the emperor by the people's grace to place the
            imperial crown upon his head in his own person. Severely strained
            relations between the imperial court and the episcopate resulted
            in 1860 from a pamphlet against the papacy inspired by the
            government (<a href="#Section_185_Para_3" class="tei tei-ref">§
            185, 3</a>). Dupanloup, Bishop of Orleans, was one of the oldest
            and most determined defenders of the interests of the papal see,
            and from Poitiers the emperor was pretty openly characterized as
            a second Pilate. The government did not venture directly to
            interfere between the two, but reminded the bishops that the
            emperor's differences with the pope referred only to temporal
            affairs. It also forbade the forming of separate societies for
            the collecting of Peter's pence, and dissolved the societies of
            St. Vincent, instituted for benevolent purposes, but misused for
            ultramontane agitations. When Archbishop Desprez of Toulouse,
            like his predecessors in 1662 and 1762, on May 16th, 1862, with
            pompous phrases of piety appointed the jubilee festival of the

            hundred years before, by means of shameful treachery and base
            breach of pledges 4,000 Protestants were murdered (§ 139, 15), a
            shout of indignation rose from almost all French journals and the
            government forbade the ceremonial. It also refused permission to
            proclaim the papal encyclical with the syllabus (<a href=
            "#Section_185_Para_2" class="tei tei-ref">§ 185, 2</a>) and
            condemned several bishops who disobeyed for misuse of their
            office. Under the influence of the ultramontane empress Eugenie,
            however, the relation of the government to the curia and the
            higher clergy of the empire, since the one could not do without
            the other, became more friendly and intimate, till the day of
            Sedan, September 2nd, 1870, put an end to the Napoleonic empire
            and the temporal power of the papacy which it had maintained.</p>

            an assembly in Strassburg and the Reformed in Paris consulted
            about a new organization of their churches. But as the latter
            resolved in order to maintain constitutional union amid doctrinal
            diversity, entirely to set aside symbol and dogma, pastor Fr.
            Monod and Count Gasparin, the noble defenders of French
            Protestantism, lodged a protest, and with thirty congregations of
            the strict party constituted a new council at Paris in 1849,
            independent of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page382">[pg

            Napoleon gave to the Reformed Church a central council in Paris
            with consistories and presbyteries; to the Lutheran, an annual
            general consistory as a legislative court and a standing
            directory as an administrative court. The Lutheran theological
            faculty at Strassburg with its vigorous unconfessional science
            represents the westernmost school of Schleiermacher's theology.
            The academy at Montauban, with Adolph Monod at its head,
            represents Reformed orthodoxy, not strictly confessional but
            coloured by methodistic piety, and Coquerel in Paris, was the
            head of the rationalistic party of the Reformed national church.
            The lead in the reaction against rationalism since 1830 has been
            taken by the <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "fr"><span style="font-style: italic">Société
            évangélique</span></span> at Paris, which, aiming at the
            Protestantising of France, and using for this end Bible
            colportage, tract distribution, the sending out of evangelists,
            school instruction, etc., has developed an extraordinarily
            restless and successful activity. It has been powerfully
            supported by the evangelical society of Geneva. The number of
            Protestant clergymen in France has steadily risen, and almost
            every year in and out of the Catholic population new evangelical
            congregations have been formed, in spite of endless difficulties
            put in the way by Catholic courts. In Strassburg, in 1854, the
            Jesuits persuaded the Catholic prefects to recall and arrest the
            revenues of the former St. Thomas institute, which since the
            Reformation had been applied to the maintenance of a Protestant
            gymnasium. The prefect of Paris, however, was instructed to
            desist from his claims. In the speech from the throne in 1858,
            the emperor declared that the government secured for Protestants
            full liberty of worship, without forgetting, however, that
            Catholicism is the religion of the majority, and the <span lang=
            "fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Moniteur</span></span> commented on this
            imperial speech so evidently in the spirit of the <span lang="fr"
            class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Univers</span></span>, that the prefects
            could not be in doubt how to understand it. By General Espinasse,
            who, after the Orsini attempt on the emperor's life in 1858,
            officiated for a long time as Minister of the Interior, the
            prefects were expressly instructed, to extend their espionage of
            the ill-affected press to the proceedings of the evangelical
            societies, and to prohibit the colportage of Protestant Bibles.
            On a change of minister, however, the latter enactment was
            withdrawn, and only agents of foreign Bible societies were
            interfered with. By an imperial decree of 1859, the right of
            permitting of the opening of new Protestant churches and chapels
            was taken from the local courts and transferred to the imperial
            council of state. For every Protestant congregation, so soon as
            it numbered 400 souls, the legal state salary for the clergymen
            would be paid.</p>

            nation, which, although through clerical influence upon the
            electors predominantly monarchical and clerical, appointed the
            old Voltairean Thiers (died, 1877), formerly ministerial
            president under Louis Philippe, as alone qualified for the
            difficult post of president of the republic. In the necessary
            second vote, indeed, there was a considerable increase of the
            republican and as such thoroughly anti-clerical party; but even
            in its ranks it was admitted that the establishment of France as
            leader of all Europe in the fight against ultramontanism and the
            co-operation therein of the clergy were the absolutely
            indispensable means for the political <span lang="fr" class=

            "font-style: italic">Revanche</span></span>, after which the
            hearts of all Frenchmen longed as the hart for the water streams.
            A petition from five bishops and other dignitaries to the
            National Assembly for the restoration of the temporal power of
            the pope was set aside as inopportune. But Archbishop Guibert of
            Paris, without asking the government, proclaimed the
            infallibility dogma, and the minister of instruction, Jules
            Simon, contented himself with warning the episcopate in a
            friendly way against any further illegal steps of that kind. The
            clerical party was also successful in its protest to the National
            Assembly against the education law, which by raising the standard
            of instruction, placing it under the supervision of the state and
            making inspection of schools obligatory, proposed to put an end
            to the terrible ignorance of the French people as the chief cause
            of their deep decay. Bishop Dupanloup of Orleans was appointed
            president of the commission for examining it, and so its fate was
            sealed. Meanwhile the people, by frequent manifestations of the
            Virgin, were roused to a high pitch of religious excitement.
            Crowds of pilgrims encouraged by miraculous healings flocked to
            our Lady of La Salette, at Lourdes, etc. (<a href=
            "#Section_188_Para_6" class="tei tei-ref">§ 188, 6</a>), and the
            consecration of <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "fr"><span style="font-style: italic">Notre Dame de la
            Deliverance</span></span> at Bayeux was celebrated as a brilliant
            national festival. When in May, 1873, Thiers gave way before the
            machinations of his opponents and, under the new president,
            Marshal Macmahon, the thoroughly clerical ministry of the Duc de
            Broglie got the helm of affairs, the pilgrimage craze, mariolatry
            and ultramontane piety, aided by the prefects and mayors,
            increased to an unparalleled extent among all ranks. Under the
            Buffet ministry of 1875 the influence of clericalism was
            unabated. To him it owed its most important acquisition, the
            right of creating free Catholic universities wholly independent
            of the State, with the privilege of conferring degrees. But when
            in 1876 the new elections for the National Assembly gave an
            anti-clerical majority, Buffet was obliged to resign. The new
            Dufaure ministry, with the Protestant Waddington as minister of
            instruction, declared indeed that it continued the liberty of
            instruction, but decidedly refused the right of conferring
            degrees. The proposal to this effect met with the <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page384">[pg 384]</span><a name="Pg384" id=
            "Pg384" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> hearty support of the new
            chamber of deputies. But all the greater was the jubilation of
            the clericals when the senate by a small majority refused its
            consent, and all the more eagerly was the founding of new free
            Catholic universities carried on, at Paris, Angers, Lyons, Lille
            and Toulouse, but notwithstanding every effort they only
            attracted a very small number of scholars,—in 1879, when they
            flourished most, at all the five there were only 742
            students.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><a name=

            succeeded in December, 1876, by the semi-liberal ministry of
            Jules Simon, which again was driven out in a summary fashion by
            president Macmahon on May 16th, 1877, and replaced, on the
            dissolution of the chamber, by a clerical ministry under Duc de
            Broglie. But in the newly elected chamber the republican
            anti-clerical majority was so overwhelming that Macmahon, on
            January 30th, 1879, abandoning his motto of government,
            <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "fr"><span style="font-style: italic">J'y suis et j'y
            reste</span></span>, was at last obliged, between the
            alternatives offered him by Gambetta, <span lang="fr" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Se soumettre ou se démettre</span></span>,
            to choose the latter. His successor was Grévy, president of the
            Chamber, who entrusted the protestant Waddington with the forming
            of a new ministry in which Jules Ferry was minister of
            instruction. Ferry brought in a bill in March to abolish the
            representation of the clergy in the High Council of Education by
            four archiepiscopal deputies, continuing indeed the free Catholic
            universities, but requiring their students to enroll in a state
            university which alone could hold examinations and give degrees,
            and finally enacting by Article 7 that the right of teaching in
            all educational institutions should be refused to members of all
            religious orders and congregations not recognised by the state.
            The chamber deputies accepted this bill without amendment on July
            9th, but the senate on March 7th, 1880, after passing six
            articles refused to adopt the seventh. On March 29th, the
            president of the republic issued on his own authority two
            decrees, based indeed upon earlier enactments (1789-1852), gone
            into desuetude indeed, but never abrogated (<a href=
            "#Section_186_Para_2" class="tei tei-ref">§ 186, 2</a>), demanded
            the dissolution of the Society of Jesus, containing 1,480 members
            in 56 institutions, within three months, and insisted that the
            orders and congregations not recognised by the State, embracing
            14,033 sisters in 602 institutions and 7,444 brothers in 384
            institutions, in the same time should by production of their
            statutes and rules seek formal recognition or else be broken up.
            A storm of protests on the part of the bishops greeted these
            <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">March Decrees</span></em>,”</span> and
            riotous demonstrations made before the Minister of Instruction at
            his residence at Lille expressed the protests of the students of
            the Catholic university there. The pope now broke his reserve and
            by a nuncio sent the president of the republic a holograph letter
            in which he declared that he must interfere on behalf of the
            Jesuits and the threatened orders, because they were
            indispensably <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page385">[pg
            385]</span><a name="Pg385" id="Pg385" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            necessary to the wellbeing of the church. He did not wish that
            they should have recourse to unlawful means, but it must be
            understood that they would appeal to the courts for protection of
            their threatened civil liberties. When therefore on the morning
            of June 30th the police began their work of expelling the Jesuits
            from their houses, these lodged a complaint before the courts of
            invasion of their domestic peace and infringement of their
            personal liberty. Their schools were closed on August 31st, the
            end of the school year; meanwhile they had taken the precaution
            to transfer most of them to such as would be ready afterwards to
            restore them. The enforcement of the second of the March Decrees
            against the other orders was delayed for a while. A compromise
            proposed by the episcopate, favoured by the pope and not
            absolutely rejected even by the minister Freycinet, Waddington's
            successor, according to which instead of the required application
            for recognition all these orders should sign a declaration of
            loyalty, undertaking to avoid all participation in political
            affairs and to do nothing opposed to existing order, brought
            about the overthrow of this ministry in September, 1880, by the
            machinations from other motives of the president of the chamber
            and latent dictator, Leon Gambetta. At the head of the new
            ministry was Ferry, who held the portfolio of instruction, and
            under him the carrying out of the second March Decree began on
            October 16th, 1880. Up to the meeting of the chamber in November
            261 monasteries had been vacated; the rest, as from the first all
            female congregations, were spared, so that France with its
            colonies and mission stations still number 4,288 male and 14,990
            female settlements of spiritual orders, the former with about
            32,000, the latter with about 166,200 inmates.—The expulsion of
            the Jesuits, as well as the more recent of the other orders, was,
            however, stoutly opposed. The police told off for this duty found
            doors shut and barricaded against them or defended by fanatical
            peasants and mobs of shrieking women, so that they had often to
            be stormed and broken up by the military. Still more threatening
            than this opposition was the reaction which began to assert
            itself at the instance of the almost thoroughly ultramontane
            jurists of the country, a survival of the times of Napoleon III.
            and Macmahon. An advocate Rousse, who publicly stated the opinion
            that the March Decrees were illegal and therefore not binding,
            was supported by 2,000 attorneys and over 200 corporations of
            attorneys and by many distinguished university jurists. More than
            200 state officials and many judiciary and police officers,
            together with several officers of the army, tendered their
            resignations so as to avoid taking part in the execution of the
            decrees. When it became clear that unfavourable verdicts would be
            given by the courts invoked by the Jesuits against the executors
            of the decree, as indeed was soon actually done by several
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page386">[pg 386]</span><a name=
            "Pg386" id="Pg386" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> courts, the
            government lodged an appeal against their competence before the
            tribunal of conflicts which also actually in regard to all such
            cases pronounced them incompetent and their decisions therefore
            null and void; but the complainers insisted that their complaints
            should be taken to a Council of State as the only court suitable
            to deal with charges against officials, which, as might be
            expected, was not done.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">7. In the
            future course of the French <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Kulturkampf”</span> the most important proceedings
            of the government were the following: The abolition of the
            institute of military chaplains, highly serviceable in
            ultramontanizing the officers, was carried out in 1880, as well
            as the requirement that the clergy and teachers should give
            military service for one year, and subsequently also military
            escorts to the Corpus Christi procession were forbidden. In 1880
            the Municipal Council of Paris, with the concurrence of the
            prefect of the Seine, forbad the continuance of the beautiful
            building of the church of the Heart of Jesus begun in 1875 on
            Montmartre (<a href="#Section_188_Para_12" class="tei tei-ref">§
            188, 12</a>), confiscating the site that had been granted for it.
            In 1881 the churchyards were relieved of their denominational
            character, and the following year the right of managing them,
            with permission of merely civil interment without the aid of a
            clergyman, was transferred from the ecclesiastical to the civil
            authorities. By introducing in 1880 high schools for girls with
            boarding establishments an end was put to the education of girls
            of the upper ranks in nunneries, which had hitherto been the
            almost exclusive practice. Far more sweeping was the School Act
            brought in by the radical minister of worship, Paul Bert, and
            first enforced in October, 1886, which made attendance
            compulsory, relegated religious instruction wholly to the church
            and home, and absolutely excluded all the clergy from the right
            of giving any sort of instruction in the public schools, and
            demanded the removal of all crucifixes and other religious
            symbols from the school buildings. In December, 1884, a tax was
            imposed on the property of all religious orders, also the state
            allowance for the five Catholic seminaries with only thirty-seven
            students was withdrawn, and many other important deductions made
            upon the budget for Catholic worship, which at first the senate
            opposed, but at last agreed to. The Divorce Bill frequently
            introduced since 1881, which permitted parties to marry again,
            and gave disposal of the matter to the civil court, got the
            assent of the senate only in the end of July, 1884. The clericals
            were also greatly offended by the decree passed in May, 1885,
            which closed the church of St. Genoveva, the former Pantheon, as
            a place of worship and made it again a burial place for
            distinguished Frenchmen. This resolution was first carried out by
            placing there the remains of Victor Hugo. Amid these and many
            other injuries to its interests the Roman curia, concentrating
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page387">[pg 387]</span><a name=
            "Pg387" id="Pg387" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> all its energies
            upon the German <span class="tei tei-q">“Kulturkampf,”</span>
            endeavoured to keep things back in a moderate way. Yet in July,
            1883, the pope addressed to president Grévy a friendly but
            earnest remonstrance, which he treated simply as a private letter
            and, without communicating it officially to his cabinet, answered
            that apart from parliament he could not act, but that so far as
            he and his ministry were able they would seek to avoid conflict
            with the holy see. And in fact the government, especially after
            the overthrow of the Gambetta ministry in 1882, often
            successfully opposed the proposal of the radical chamber,
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span> the separation of church
            and state, the abrogation of the concordat, the recall of the
            embassy to the Vatican, the abolition of religious oaths in the
            proceedings of the courts, the stopping of the state subvention
            of a million francs for payment of salaries in seminaries for
            priests, etc.</p>

            "font-style: italic">The Protestant Churches under the Third
            Republic.</span></em>—Since the French Reformed began to emulate
            their Catholic countrymen in wild Chauvinism, fanatical hatred of
            Germany and unreasoning enthusiasm for the <span lang="fr" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Revanche</span></span>, they were left by
            the advancing clerical party unmolested in respect of life,
            confession and worship during the time of war. The Lutherans on
            the other hand, consisting, although on French territory, mainly
            of German emigrants and settlers, even their French members not
            so disposed to Chauvinistic extravagance, were obliged to atone
            for this double offence by expulsion from house and home and by
            various injuries to their ecclesiastical interests. After the
            conclusion of peace, especially under Thiers' moderate
            government, this fanaticism gradually cooled down, so that the
            expelled Germans returned and the churches and institutions that
            had been destroyed were restored, so far as means would allow. By
            the decree of Waddington, the minister of instruction, of date
            March 27th, 1877, instead of the theological faculty of
            Strassburg, now lost for the French Lutheran church, one for both
            Protestant churches was founded in Paris.—The <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Lutheran
            Church</span></em>, in consequence of the cession of
            Alsace-Lorraine, had only sixty-four out of 278 pastorates and
            six out of forty-four consistories remaining. At the general
            synod convened at Paris, in July, 1872, by the government for
            reorganising the Lutheran church it was resolved: To form two
            inspectorates independent of each other—Paris, predominantly
            orthodox, Mömpelgard, predominantly liberal; the general
            assembly, which meets every third year alternately at Mömpelgard
            and Paris, to consist of delegates from both. The two
            inspectorates are to correspond in administrative matters
            directly with the minister of public instruction, but in
            everything referring to confession, doctrine, worship and
            discipline, the general assembly is the supreme authority. In
            regard to the confessional question they agreed to the statement,
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page388">[pg 388]</span><a name=
            "Pg388" id="Pg388" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> that the holy
            Scripture is the supreme authority in matters of faith, and the
            Augsburg Confession the basis of the legal constitution of the
            church. An express undertaking on the part of the clergy to this
            effect is not, however, insisted upon. Only in 1879 could this
            constitution obtain legal sanction by the State, and that only
            after considerable modification in the direction of liberalism,
            especially in reference to electoral qualification. In
            consequence of this the first ordinary general assembly held in
            Paris in May, 1881, found both parties in a conciliatory
            mood.—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">The Reformed Church</span></em>, with about
            500 pastorates and 105 consistories, summoned by order of
            government a newly constituted General Assembly at Paris, in
            June, 1872. Prominent among the leaders of the orthodox party was
            the aged ex-minister Guizot; the leaders of the liberals were
            Coquerel and Colani. The former supported the proposal of
            Professor Bois of Montauban, who insisted on the frank and full
            confession of holy Scripture as the sovereign authority in
            matters of faith, of Christ as the only Son of God, and of
            justification by faith as the legal basis of instruction, worship
            and discipline; while the latter protested against every attempt
            to lay down an obligatory and exclusive confession. The orthodox
            party prevailed and the dissenters who would not yield were
            struck off the voting lists. When now in consequence of the
            complaint of the liberal party the summoning of an ordinary
            general assembly was refused by the government, the orthodox
            party repeatedly met in <span class="tei tei-q">“official”</span>
            provincial and general assemblies without state sanction. The
            council of state then declared all decisions regarding voting
            qualifications passed by the synod of 1872 to be null and void,
            the minister of worship, Ferry, ordered the readmission of
            electors struck from the lists, and his successor Bert legalized,
            by a decree of March 25th, 1882, the division of the Parisian
            consistorial circuit into two independent consistories of Paris
            and Versailles, moved for by the liberal party but opposed by the
            orthodox. But upon the elections for the new consistory of Paris,
            ordered in spite of all protests, and for the presbyteries of the
            eight parishes assigned to it, contrary to all expectation, in
            seven of these the elections with great majorities were in favour
            of the orthodox, and the first official document issued by the
            new consistory was a solemn protest against the decree to which
            it owed its existence. Under such circumstances the government as
            well as the liberal party had no desire for the calling of an
            official general assembly, and the latter resolved at a general
            assembly at Nimes, in October, 1882, to institute official synods
            of their own for consultation and protection of their own
            interests.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Italy
            matters returned to their old position after the restoration of
            1814. But liberalism, aiming at the liberty and unity of Italy,
            gained the mastery, and where for the time it prevailed, the
            Jesuits were expelled, and the power of the clergy restricted;
            where it failed, both came back with greatly increased
            importance. The arms of Austria and subsequently also of France
            stamped out on all sides the revolutionary movements. Pius IX.,
            who at first was not indisposed, contrary to all traditions of
            the papacy, to put himself at the head of the national party, was
            obliged bitterly to regret his dealings with the liberals
            (<a href="#Section_185_Para_2" class="tei tei-ref">§ 185, 2</a>).
            Sardinia, Modena and Naples put the severest strain upon the bow
            of the restoration, while Parma and Tuscany distinguished
            themselves by adopting liberal measures in a moderate degree.
            Sardinia, however, in 1840 came to a better mind. Charles Albert
            first broke ground with a more liberal constitution, and in 1848
            proclaimed himself the deliverer of Italy, but yielded to the
            arms of Austria. His son Victor Emanuel II. succeeded amid
            singularly favourable circumstances in uniting the whole
            peninsula under his sceptre as a united kingdom of Italy governed
            by liberal institutions.</p>

            "font-style: italic">The Kingdom of Sardinia.</span></em>—Victor
            Emanuel I. after the restoration had nothing else to do but to
            recall the Jesuits, to hand over to them the whole management of
            the schools, and, guided and led by them in everything, to
            restore the church and state to the condition prevailing before
            1789. Charles Felix (1821-1831) carried still further the
            absolutist-reactionary endeavours of his predecessor, and even
            Charles Albert (1831-1849) refused for a long time to realize the
            hopes which the liberal party had previously placed in him. Only
            in the second decade of his reign did he begin gradually to
            display a more liberal tendency, and at last in 1848 when, in
            consequence of the French Revolution, Lombardy rose against the
            Austrian rule, he placed himself at the head of the national
            movement for freeing Italy <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page390">[pg 390]</span><a name="Pg390" id="Pg390" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> from the yoke of strangers. But the king
            gloried in as <span class="tei tei-q">“the sword of Italy”</span>
            was defeated and obliged to abdicate. Victor Emanuel II.
            (1849-1878) allowed meanwhile the liberal constitution of his
            father to remain and indeed carried it out to the utmost. The
            minister of justice, Siccardi, proposed a new legislative code
            which abolished all clerical jurisdiction in civil and criminal
            proceedings, as also the right of asylum and of exacting tithes,
            the latter with moderate compensation. It was passed by
            parliament and subscribed by the king in 1850. The clergy, with
            archbishop Fransoni of Turin at their head, protested with all
            their might against these sacrilegious encroachments on the
            rights of the church. Fransoni was on this account committed for
            a month to prison and, when he refused the last sacrament to a
            minister, was regularly sentenced to deposition and banishment
            from the country. Pius IX. thwarted all attempts to obtain a new
            concordat. But the government went recklessly forward. As
            Fransoni from his exile in France continued his agitation, all
            the property of the archiepiscopal chair was in 1854 sequestered
            and a number of cloisters were closed. Soon all penalties in the
            penal code for spreading non-Catholic doctrines were struck out
            and non-Catholic soldiers freed from compulsory attendance at
            mass on Sundays and festivals. The chief blow now fell on March
            2nd, 1855, in the Cloister Act, which abolished all orders and
            cloisters not devoted to preaching, teaching, and nursing the
            sick. In consequence 331 out of 605 cloisters were shut up. The
            pope ceased not to condemn all these sacrilegious and church
            robbing acts, and when his threats were without result, thundered
            the great excommunication in July, 1855, against all originators,
            aiders, and abettors of such deeds. Among the masses this indeed
            caused some excitement, but it never came to an explosion.</p>

            "font-style: italic">The Kingdom of Italy.</span></em>—Amid such
            vigorous progress the year 1859 came round with its fateful
            Franco-Italian war. The French alliance had not indeed, as it
            promised, made Italy free to the Adriatic, but by the peace of
            Villafranca the whole of Lombardy was given to the kingdom of
            Sardinia as a present from the emperor of the French. In the same
            year by popular vote Tuscany, including Modena and Parma, and in
            the following year the kingdom of the two Sicilies, as well as
            the three provinces of the States of the Church, revolted and
            were annexed, so that the new kingdom of Italy embraced the whole
            of the peninsula, with the exception of Venice, Rome and the
            Campagna. Prussia's remarkable successes in the seven days'
            German war of 1866 shook Venice like ripe fruit into the lap of
            her Italian ally, and the day of Sedan, 1870, prepared the way
            for the addition of Rome and the Campagna (<a href=
            "#Section_185_Para_3" class="tei tei-ref">§ 185, 3</a>).—In
            Lombardy and then also in Venice, immediately after they had been
            taken possession of, the concordat with Austria was abrogated and
            the Jesuits expelled. Ecclesiastical tithes <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page391">[pg 391]</span><a name="Pg391" id=
            "Pg391" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> on the produce of the soil
            were abolished throughout the whole kingdom, begging was
            forbidden the mendicant friars as unworthy of a spiritual order,
            ecclesiastical property was put under state control and the
            support of the clergy provided for by state grants. In 1867 the
            government began the appropriation and conversion of the church
            property; in 1870 all religious orders were dissolved, with
            exception for the time being of those in Rome, wherever they did
            not engage in educational and other useful works. In May, 1873,
            this law was extended to the Roman province, only it was not to
            be applied to the generals of orders in Rome. Nuns and some monks
            were also allowed to remain in their cloisters situated in
            unpeopled districts. The amount of state pensions paid to monks
            and nuns reached in 1882 the sum of eleven million lire, at the
            rate of 330 lire for each person. The abolition of the
            theological faculties in ten Italian universities in 1873,
            because these altogether had only six students of theology, was
            regarded by the curia rather as a victory than a defeat. The
            newly appointed bishops were forbidden by the pope to produce
            their credentials for inspection in order to obtain their
            salaries from the government. The loss of temporalities thus
            occasioned was made up by Pius IX. out of Peter's pence flowing
            in so abundantly from abroad; each bishop receiving 500 and each
            archbishop 700 lire in the month. Leo XIII., however, felt
            obliged in 1879, owing to the great decrease in the Peter's pence
            contributions, to cancel this enactment and to permit the bishops
            to accept the state allowance. In consequence of the civil
            marriage law passed in 1866 having been altogether ignored by the
            clergy, nearly 400,000 marriages had down to the close of 1878
            received only ecclesiastical sanction, and the offspring of such
            parties would be regarded in the eye of the law as illegitimate.
            To obviate this difficulty a law was passed in May, 1879, which
            insisted that in all cases civil marriage must precede the
            ecclesiastical ceremony, and clergymen, witnesses and parties
            engaging in an illegal marriage should suffer three or six
            months' imprisonment; but all marriages contracted in accordance
            merely with church forms before the passing of this law might be
            legitimized by being entered on the civil register.—Finally in
            January, 1884, the controversy pending since 1873 as to whether
            the rich property of the Roman propaganda (<a href=
            "#Section_156_Para_9" class="tei tei-ref">§ 156, 9</a>) amounting
            to twenty million lire should be converted into state consols was
            decided by the supreme court in favour of the curia, which had
            pronounced these funds international because consisting of
            presents and contributions from all lands. But not only was the
            revenue of the propaganda subjected to a heavy tax, but also all
            increase of its property forbidden. In vain did the pope by his
            nuncios call for the intervention of foreign nations. None of
            these were inclined to meddle in the internal affairs of Italy.
            The curia now devised the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            "font-style: italic">The Evangelization of
            Italy.</span></em>—Emigrant Protestants of various nationalities
            had at an early date, by the silent sufferance of the respective
            governments, formed small evangelical congregations in some of
            the Italian cities; in Venice and Leghorn during the seventeenth
            century, at Bergamo in 1807, at Florence in 1826, at Milan in
            1847. Also by aid of the diplomatic intervention of Prussia and
            England, the erection of Protestant chapels for the embassy was
            allowed at Rome in 1819, at Naples in 1825, and at Florence in
            1826. When in 1848 Italy's hopes from the liberal tendencies of
            Pius IX. were so bitterly disappointed, Protestant sympathies
            began to spread far and wide through the land, even among native
            Catholics, fostered by English missionaries, Bibles and tracts,
            which the governments sought in vain to check by prisons,
            penitentiaries and exile. Persecution began in 1851 in Tuscany,
            where, in spite of the liberty of faith and worship guaranteed by
            the constitution of 1848, Tuscan subjects taking part in the
            Italian services in the chapel of the Prussian embassy at
            Florence were punished with six months' hard labour, and in the
            following year the pious pair Francesco and Rosa Madiai were
            sentenced to four years' rigorous punishment in a penitentiary
            for the crime of having edified themselves and their household by
            reading the Bible. In vain did the Evangelical Alliance
            remonstrate (<a href="#Section_178_Para_3" class="tei tei-ref">§
            178, 3</a>), in vain did even the king of Prussia intercede. But
            when, stirred up by public opinion in England, the English
            premier Lord Palmerston offered to secure the requirement of
            Christian humanity by means of British ships of war, the
            grand-duke got rid of both martyrs by banishing them from the
            country in 1853. In proportion as the union of Italy under Victor
            Emanuel II. advanced, the field for evangelistic effort and the
            powers devoted thereto increased. So it was too since 1860 in
            Southern Italy. But when in 1866 a Protestant congregation began
            to be formed at Barletta in Naples, a fanatical priest roused a
            popular mob in which seventeen persons were killed and torn in
            pieces. The government put down the uproar and punished the
            miscreants, and the nobler portion of the nation throughout the
            whole land collected for the families of those murdered. The work
            of evangelization supported by liberal contributions chiefly from
            England, but also from Holland, Switzerland, and the German
            <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=

            (<a href="#Section_178_Para_1" class="tei tei-ref">§ 178, 1</a>),
            advanced steadily in spite of occasional brutal interferences of
            the clergy and the mob, so that soon in all the large cities and
            in many of the smaller towns of Italy and Sicily there were
            thriving and flourishing little evangelical congregations of
            converted native Catholics, numbering as many as 182 in 1882.</p>

            southern coast of Sicily was the old <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Waldensian
            Church</span></em>, which for three hundred years had occupied
            the Protestant platform in the spirit of Calvinism (§ 139, 25).
            Remnants consisting of some 200,000 souls still survived in the
            valleys of Piedmont, almost without protection of law amid
            constant persecution and oppressions (<a href=
            "#Section_153_Para_5" class="tei tei-ref">§ 153, 5</a>),
            moderated only by Prussian and English intervention. But when
            Sardinia headed Italian liberalism in 1848 religious liberty and
            all civil rights were secured to them. A Waldensian congregation
            was then formed in the capital, Turin, which was strengthened by
            numerous Protestant refugees from other parts of Italy. But in
            1854 a split occurred between the two elements in it. The new
            Italian converts objected, not altogether without ground, against
            the old Waldensians that by maintaining their church government
            with its centre in the valleys, the so-called <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Tables”</span> and their old forms of constitution,
            doctrine and worship, much too contracted and narrow for the
            enlarged boundaries of the present, they thought more of
            Waldensianizing than of evangelizing Italy. Besides, their
            language since 1630, when a plague caused their preachers and
            teachers to withdraw from Geneva, had been French, and the
            national Italian pride was disposed on this domain also to unfurl
            her favourite banner <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="it"
            class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="it"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Italia farà da se</span></span>.”</span> The
            division spread from Turin to the other congregations. At the
            head of the separatists, afterwards designated the <span class=

            libera</span></span>), stood Dr. Luigi Desanctis, a man of rich
            theological culture and glowing eloquence, who, when Catholic
            priest and theologian of the inquisition at Rome, became
            convinced of the truth of the evangelical confession, joined the
            evangelical church at Malta in 1847 and wrought from 1852 with
            great success in the congregation at Turin. After ten years'
            faithful service in the newly formed free church he felt obliged,
            owing to the Darbyite views (<a href="#Section_211_Para_11"
            class="tei tei-ref">§ 211, 11</a>) that began to prevail in it,
            to attach himself again in 1864 to the Waldensians, who meanwhile
            had been greatly liberalised. He now officiated for them till his
            death in 1869 as professor of theology at Florence, and edited
            their journal <span lang="it" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=

            representative was the ex-Barnabite father Alessandro Gavazzi of
            Naples. Endowed with glowing eloquence and remarkable popularity
            as a lecturer, he appeared at Rome in 1848 as a
            politico-religious orator, attached himself to the evangelical
            church in London in 1850, and undertook the charge of the
            evangelical Italian congregation there. He returned to Italy in
            1860 and accompanied the hero of Italian liberty, Garibaldi, as
            his military chaplain, preaching to the people everywhere with
            his leonine voice with equal enthusiasm of Victor Emanuel as the
            only saviour of Italy and of Jesus Christ as the only Saviour of
            sinners. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page394">[pg
            394]</span><a name="Pg394" id="Pg394" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            He then joined the <span lang="it" class="tei tei-foreign"
            xml:lang="it"><span style="font-style: italic">Chiesa
            libera</span></span>, and, as he himself obtained gradually
            fuller acquaintance with evangelical truth, wrought zealously in
            organizing the congregations hitherto almost entirely isolated
            from one another. At a general assembly at Milan in 1870,
            deputies from thirty-two congregations drew up a simple biblical
            confession of faith, and in the following year at Florence a
            constitutional code was adopted which recognised the necessity of
            the pastoral office, of annual assemblies, and a standing
            evangelization committee. They now took the name <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“<span lang="it" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "it"><span style="font-style: italic">Unione della Chiesa libere
            in Italia</span></span>.”</span> The predominantly Darbyist
            congregations, which had not taken part in these constitutional
            assemblies, have since formed a community of their own as
            <span lang="it" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "it"><span style="font-style: italic">Chiesa
            Cristiana</span></span>, depending only on the immediate leading
            of the Holy Spirit, rejecting every sort of ecclesiastical and
            official organization, and denouncing infant baptism as
            unevangelical.—Besides these three national Italian churches,
            English and American Methodists and Baptists carry on active
            missions. On May 1st, 1884, the evangelical denominations at a
            general assembly in Florence, with the exception only of the
            Darbyist <span lang="it" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "it"><span style="font-style: italic">Chiesa
            Cristiana</span></span>, joined in a confederation to meet
            annually in an <span class="tei tei-q">“Italian Evangelical
            Congress”</span> as a preparation for ecclesiastical union. When,
            however, the various Methodist and Baptist denominations began to
            check the progress of the work of union, the two leading bodies,
            the Waldensians and the Free Church party, separated from them. A
            committee chosen from these two sketched at Florence in 1885 a
            basis of union, according to which the Free Church adopted the
            confession and church order of the Waldensians, subject to
            revision by the joint synods, their theological school at Rome
            was to be amalgamated with the Waldensian school at Florence, and
            the united church was to take the name of the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Evangelical Church of Italy.”</span> But a
            Waldensian synod in September, 1886, resolved to hold by the
            ancient name of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Waldensian
            Church.”</span> Whether the <span class="tei tei-q">“Free
            Church”</span> will agree to this demand is not yet known.</p>

            the Spaniards a constitution of the French pattern, abolishing
            inquisition and cloisters. The constitution which the Cortes
            proclaimed in 1812 carried out still further the demands of
            political liberalism, but still declared the apostolic Roman
            Catholic religion as alone true to be the religion of the Spanish
            nation and forbad the exercise of any other. Ferdinand VII., whom
            Napoleon restored in December, 1813, hastened to restore the
            inquisition, the cloisters and despotism, especially from 1815
            under the direction of the Jesuits highly esteemed by him. The
            revolution of 1820 indeed obliged him to reintroduce the
            constitution of 1812 and to banish the Jesuits; but scarcely had
            the feudal clerical party of the apostolic Junta with their army
            of faith in the field and Bourbon French intervention under the
            Duke of Angoulême again made his way clear, than he began to
            crush as before by means of his Jesuit Camarilla every liberal
            movement in church and state. But all the more successful was the
            reaction of liberalism in the civil war which broke out after
            Ferdinand's death under the regency of his fourth wife, the
            intriguing Maria Christina (1833-1837). The revolution now
            erected an inquisition, but it was one directed against the
            clergy and monks, and celebrated its <span class=
            "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">autos de
            fe</span></span>; but these were in the form of spoliation of
            cloisters and massacres of monks. Ecclesiastical tithes were
            abolished, all monkish orders suspended, the cloisters closed,
            ecclesiastical goods declared national property, and the papal
            nuncio sent over the frontier. A threatening papal allocution of
            1841 only increased the violence of the Cortes, and when Gregory
            XVI. in 1842 pronounced all decrees of the government null and
            void, it branded all intercourse with Rome as an offence against
            the state.</p>

            his brother Don Carlos, had, by abolishing the Salic law, secured
            the throne to Isabella, his own and Maria Christina's daughter.
            After the Cortes of 1843 had declared Isabella of age in her
            thirteenth year, the Spanish government became more and more
            favourable to the restoration. After long negotiations and
            vacillations under constantly changing ministries a concordat was
            at last drawn up in 1851, which returned the churches and
            cloisters that had not been sold, allowed compensation for what
            had been sold, reduced the number of bishoprics by six, put
            education and the censorship of the press under the oversight of
            the bishops, and declared the Catholic religion the only one to
            be tolerated. But although in 1854 the Holy Virgin was named
            generalissima of the brave army and her image at Atocha had
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page396">[pg 396]</span><a name=
            "Pg396" id="Pg396" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> been decorated by
            the queen with a band of the Golden Fleece, a revolution soon
            broke out in the army which threatened to deal the finishing
            stroke to ultramontanism. Meanwhile it had not fully permeated
            the republican party. The proposal of unrestricted liberty to all
            forms of worship was supported by a small minority, and the new
            constitution of 1855 called upon the Spanish nation to maintain
            and guard the Catholic religion which <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“the Spaniards profess”</span>; yet no Spaniard was
            to be persecuted on account of his faith, so long as he did not
            commit irreligious acts. A new law determined the sale of all
            church and cloister property, and compensation therefore by
            annual rents according to the existing concordat. Several bishops
            had to be banished owing to their continued opposition; the pope
            protested and recalled his legates. Clerical influence meanwhile
            regained power over the queen. The sale of church and cloister
            property was stopped, and previous possessors were indemnified
            for what had been already sold. Owing to frequent change of
            ministry, each of which manifested a tendency different from its
            predecessor, it was only in 1859 that matters were settled by a
            new concordat. In it the government admitted the inalienability
            of church property, admitted the unrestricted right of the church
            to obtain new property of any kind, and declared itself ready to
            exchange state paper money for property that had fallen into
            decay according to the estimation of the bishops. The queen
            proved her Catholic zeal at the instigation of the nun Patrocinio
            by fanatical persecution of Protestants, and hearty but vain
            sympathies for the sufferings of the pope and the expatriated
            Italian princes. Pius IX. rewarded Isabella, who seemed to him
            adorned with all the virtues, by sending her in 1868 the
            consecrated rose at a time when she was causing public scandal
            more than ever by her private life, and by her proceedings with
            her paramour Marforio had lost the last remnant of the respect
            and confidence of the Spanish nation. Eight months later her
            reign was at an end. The provisional government now ordered the
            suppression of the Society of Jesus, as well as of all cloister
            and spiritual associations, and in 1869 the Cortes sanctioned the
            draught of a new civil constitution, which required the Spanish
            nation to maintain the Catholic worship, but allowed the exercise
            of other forms of worship to strangers and as cases might arise
            even to natives, and generally made all political and civil
            rights independent of religious profession.</p>

            both is shown by a decree of 10th February, 1875, which,

            found entrance into Spain from the English settlement at
            Gibraltar, without Spain being able even in the most flourishing
            days of the restoration to prevent it, and evangelical sympathies
            began more or less openly to be expressed. Franc. Ruat, formerly
            a lascivious Spanish poet, who was awakened at Turin by the
            preaching of the Waldensian Desanctis, and by reading the Bible
            had obtained knowledge of evangelical truths, appeared publicly
            after the publication of the new constitution of 1855 as a
            preacher of the gospel in Spain. The reaction that soon set in,
            however, secured for him repeated imprisonments, and finally in
            1856 sentence of banishment for life. He then wrought for several
            years successfully in Gibraltar, next in London, afterwards in
            Algiers among Spanish residents, till the new civil constitution
            of 1868 allowed him to return to Spain, where, in the service of
            the German mission at Madrid, he gathered around him an
            evangelical congregation, to which he ministered till his death
            in 1878. While labouring in Gibraltar he won to the evangelical
            faith among others the young officer Manuel Matamoros, living
            there as a political refugee. This noble man, whose whole career,
            till his death in exile in 1866, was a sore martyrdom for the
            truth, became the soul of the whole movement, against which the
            government in 1861 and 1862 took the severest measures. By
            intercepted correspondence the leaders and many of the members of
            the secret evangelical propaganda were discovered and thrown into
            prison. The final judgment condemned the leaders of the movement
            to severe punishment in penitentiaries and the galleys.
            Infliction of these sentences had already begun when the queen
            found herself obliged, by a visit to Madrid in <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page398">[pg 398]</span><a name="Pg398" id=
            "Pg398" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> 1863 of a deputation of the
            Evangelical Alliance (<a href="#Section_178_Para_3" class=
            "tei tei-ref">§ 178, 3</a>), consisting of the most distinguished
            and respected Protestants of all lands, to commute them to
            banishment.—After Isabella's overthrow in 1868, permission was
            given for the building of the first Protestant church in Madrid,
            where a congregation soon gathered of more than 2,000 souls. In
            Seville an almost equally strong congregation obtained for its
            services what had been a church of the Jesuits. Also at Cordova a
            considerable congregation was collected, and in almost all the
            other large cities there were largely attended places of worship.
            Several of those banished under Isabella, who had returned after
            her overthrow, Carrasco, Trigo, Alhama, and others, increased by
            new converts who had received their theological training at
            Geneva, Lausanne, etc., and supported by American, English and
            German fellow-labourers, such as the brothers F. and H. Fliedner,
            wrought with unwearied zeal as preachers and pastors, for the
            spreading and deeper grounding of the gospel among their
            countrymen. With the restoration of the monarchy in 1875, the
            oppression of the Protestants was renewed with increasing
            severity. The widest possible interpretation was given to the
            prohibition of every public manifestation of dissenting worship
            in Article XI. of the constitution. The excesses and insults of
            the mob, whose fanaticism was stirred up by the clergy, were left
            unpunished and uncensured. Even the most sorely abused and
            injured Protestants were themselves subjected to imprisonment as
            disturbers of the peace. No essential improvement in their
            condition resulted from the liberal ministry of Sagasta in 1881.
            Nevertheless the number of evangelical congregations continued
            steadily though slowly to increase, so that now they number more
            than sixty, with somewhere about 15,000 native Protestant
            members.—Besides these an <span lang="es" class="tei tei-foreign"
            xml:lang="es"><span style="font-style: italic">Iglesia
            Española</span></span> arose in 1881, consisting of eight
            congregations, which may be regarded to some extent as a national
            Spanish counterpart to the Old Catholicism of Germany. Its
            founder and first bishop is Cabrera, formerly a Catholic priest,
            who, after having wrought from 1868 in the service of the
            Edinburgh (Presbyterian) Evangelization Society as preacher in
            Seville, and then in Madrid, received in 1880 episcopal
            consecration from the Anglican bishop Riley of Mexico (<a href=
            "#Section_209_Para_1" class="tei tei-ref">§ 209, 1</a>), then
            visiting Madrid. Although thus of Anglican origin, the church
            directed by him wishes not to be Anglican, but Spanish episcopal.
            It attaches itself therefore, while accepting the thirty-nine
            Articles of the Anglican Church, in the sketch of its order of
            service in the Spanish language, more to the old Mozarabic ritual
            (§ 88, 1) than to the Anglican liturgy.<a id="noteref_118" name=

            after some months followed the example of the Spanish revolution
            of 1820. John VI. (1816-1826) confirmed the new constitution,
            drawn up after the pattern of the democratic Spanish constitution
            of 1812, enacting the seizure of church property and the
            suppression of the monasteries. But a counter revolution, led by
            the younger son of the king, Dom Miguel, obliged him in 1823 to
            repudiate it and to return to the older constitution. But he
            persistently resisted the reintroduction of the Jesuits. After
            his death in 1826, the legitimate heir, Pedro I. of Brazil,
            abandoned his claims to the Portuguese throne in favour of his
            daughter Donna Maria II. da Gloria, then under a year old, whom
            he betrothed to his brother Dom Miguel. Appointed regent, Dom
            Miguel took the oath to the constitution, but immediately broke
            his oath, had himself proclaimed king, recalled the Jesuits, and,
            till his overthrow in 1834, carried on a clerical monarchical
            reign of terror. Dom Pedro, who had meanwhile vacated the
            Brazilian throne, as regent again suppressed all monkish orders,
            seized the property of the church, and abolished ecclesiastical
            tithes, but died in the same year. His daughter Donna Maria, now
            pronounced of age and proclaimed queen (1834-1853), amid
            continual revolutions and changes of the constitution, manifested
            an ever-growing inclination to reconciliation with Rome. In 1841
            she negotiated about a concordat, and showed herself so
            submissive that the pope rewarded her in 1842 with the
            consecrated golden rose. But the liberal Cortes resisted the
            introduction of the concordat, and maintained the right of veto
            by the civil government as well as the rest of the restrictions
            upon the hierarchy, and the <span lang="pt" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="pt"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Codigo penal</span></span> of 1882
            threatened the Catholic clergy with heavy fines and imprisonment
            for every abuse of their spiritual prerogatives and every breach
            of the laws of the State. In 1857 a concordat was at last agreed
            to, which, however, was adopted by the representatives of the
            people not before 1859, and then only by a small majority. Its
            chief provisions consist in the regulating of the patronage
            rights of the crown in regard to existing and newly created
            bishoprics. The relation of government to the curia, however,
            still continued strained. The constitution declares generally
            that the Catholic Apostolic Romish Church is the state religion.
            A Portuguese who passes over from it to another loses thereby his
            civil rights as a citizen. Yet no one is to be persecuted on
            account of his religion. The erection of Protestant places of
            worship, but not in church form, and also of burial grounds,
            where necessary, is permitted.—Evangelization has made but little
            progress in Portugal. The first evangelical congregation, with
            Anglican episcopal constitution, was founded at Lisbon by a
            Spanish convert, Don Angelo Herrero de Mora, who in the service
            of the Bible Society <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page400">[pg
            400]</span><a name="Pg400" id="Pg400" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            had edited a revision of the old Spanish Bible in New York, and
            had there been naturalized as an American citizen. Consisting
            originally of American and English Protestants, about a hundred
            Spanish and Portuguese converts have since 1868 gradually
            attached themselves to it, the latter after they had been made
            Spanish instead of Portuguese subjects. After the pattern of this
            mother congregation, two others have been formed in the
            neighbourhood of Lisbon and one at Oporto.</p>

            government since the time of Alexander I. has sought amid many

            highly cultured clergy, and to increase its influence upon the
            life of the people; a task which proved peculiarly difficult in
            consequence of the wide-spread anti-ecclesiastical spirit
            (<a href="#Section_210_Para_3" class="tei tei-ref">§ 210, 3</a>)

            vehicle of rebellion, so compromised itself that the government,
            besides taking away the national political privileges, reduced
            more and more the rights and liberties granted to the church as
            such.—The prosperous development of the evangelical church in

            members, had hitherto enjoyed the hearty protection of the

            at the elevation of the orthodox church in this direction,
            founded clerical seminaries and public schools, and took a lively

            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1855-1881, a reign
            singularly fruitful in civil reforms, this tendency was even more
            rigidly illustrated, while with the consent and aid of the holy
            synod every effort was put forth to improve the church according
            to its own principles. Specially active in this work was Count
            Tolstoi, minister of instruction and also procurator of the holy
            synod. A committee presided over by him produced a whole series
            of useful reforms in 1868, which were approved by the synod and
            confirmed by the emperor. While the inferior clergy had hitherto
            formed an order by themselves, all higher ranks of preferment
            were now opened to them, but, on the other hand, the obligation
            of priests' sons to remain in the order of their fathers was
            abolished. The clamant abuse of putting mere clerks and sextons
            to do the work of priests was also now put a stop to, and
            training in clerical seminaries or academies was made compulsory.
            Previously only married men could hold the offices of deacon and
            priest; now widowers and bachelors were admitted, so soon as they
            reached the age of forty years. In order to increase the poor
            incomes many churches had not their regular equipment of clergy,
            and instead of the full set of priest, deacon, sub-deacon,
            reader, sexton, and doorkeeper, in the poorer churches there were
            only priest and reader. Order was restored to monastic life, now
            generally grown dissolute, by a fixed rule of a common table and
            uniform dress, etc. In 1860 an Orthodox Church Society for
            Missions among the peoples of the Caucasus, and in 1866 a second
            for Pagans and Mohammedans throughout the empire, were founded,
            both under the patronage of the empress. The Russian church also
            cleverly took advantage of political events to carry on
            missionary work in Japan (<a href="#Section_184_Para_6" class=

            was given to the evangelical movement in aristocratic circles by
            Lord Radstock, who appeared in St. Petersburg in 1870. The
            addresses delivered by him in French in the salons of the
            fashionable world won a success scarcely to be looked for. The
            most famous gain was the conversion of a hitherto proud, worldly,
            rich and popular Colonel of the Guards, called Paschcow, who now
            turned the beautiful ball-room of his palatial residence into a
            prayer-meeting room, and with all the enthusiasm of a neophyte
            proclaimed successfully among high and low the newly won saving
            truth in a Biblical evangelical spirit, though not without a
            methodistic flavour. The excitement thus created led to police
            interference, and finally, when he refused to abstain from
            spreading his religious views among the members of the orthodox
            church by the circulation of evangelical tracts in the Russian
            language, he was, at the instigation of the holy synod and its
            all powerful procurator, banished first from St. Petersburg and
            then in 1884 from the empire, whereupon he withdrew to
            London.</p>

            "font-style: italic">The Catholic Church.</span></em>—After the
            Greeks in the old West Russian provinces (§ 151, 3), who had been
            forcibly united to Rome in 1596, had again in 1772, in
            consequence of the first partition of Poland, come under Russian
            rule, the government sought to restore them also to the orthodox
            national church. This was first accomplished under Nicholas I.,
            when at the synod of Polosk in 1839 they themselves spontaneously
            expressed a wish to be thus reunited with the mother church. Rome
            thus lost two million members. But the allocution directed
            against this robbery by Gregory XVI. was without effect, and the
            public opinion of Europe saw a case of historical justice in this
            reunion, though effected not without severe measures against
            those who proved obstinate and rebellious. Yet there always
            remained a considerable remnant, about one-third of a million,
            under the bishop of Chelun, in the Romish communion. But even
            these in 1875, after many disturbances with the prelate Popiel at
            their head, almost wholly severed their connection with the pope,
            and were again received into the bosom of the orthodox national
            church. In a memorial addressed to the emperor for this purpose,
            they declared they were led to this on the one hand by the
            continual endeavour of the curia and its partisans, by Latinizing
            their old Greek liturgy and Polandizing the people, to overthrow
            their old Russian nationality, and on the other hand, by their
            aversion to the new papal dogmas of the immaculate conception of
            Mary and the infallibility of the pope.—The insurrection of the
            Poles against Russian rule in 1830, which even Pope Gregory XVI.
            condemned, bore bitter fruits for the Catholic church of that
            country. The organic statute of 1832 indeed secured <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page403">[pg 403]</span><a name="Pg403" id=
            "Pg403" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> anew to the Poles religious
            liberty, but the bishops were prohibited holding any direct
            communication with Rome, the clergy deprived of all control over
            the schools, and the Russian law regarding mixed marriages made
            applicable to that province. By an understanding with the curia
            in 1847 the choice of the bishops was given to the emperor, their
            canonical investiture to the pope. The mildness with which
            Alexander II. treated the Poles and the political troubles in the
            rest of Europe fostered the hope of restoring the old kingdom of
            Poland. Reckless demonstrations were made in the beginning of
            1861, pilgrimages to the graves of the martyrs of freedom were
            organized, political memorial festivals were celebrated in
            churches, a general national mourning was enjoined, mourning
            services were held, revolutionary songs were sung in churches,
            etc. The Catholic clergy headed the movement and canonized it as
            a religious duty. In vain the government sought to put it down by
            making liberal concessions, in vain they applied to Pius IX. to
            discountenance it. When in October the country lay in a state of
            siege, and the military forced their way into the churches to
            apprehend the ringleaders of rebellion, the episcopal
            administrator, Bialobezeski, denounced that as church
            profanation, had all the Catholic churches in Warsaw closed, and
            answered the government's request to reopen them by making
            extravagant demands and uttering proud words of defiance. The
            military tribunal sentenced him to death, but the emperor
            commuted this to one year's detention in a fortress, with loss of
            all his dignities and orders. Meanwhile the eyes of the pope had
            at length been opened. He now confirmed the government's
            appointment of Archbishop Felinsky, who entered Warsaw in
            February, 1862, and reopened the churches. After the suppression
            of the revolt in 1864, almost all cloisters, as nurseries of
            revolution, were abolished; in the following year the whole
            property of the church was taken in charge by the State, and the
            clergy supported by state pay. The pope, enraged at this, gave
            violent expression to his feelings to the Russian ambassador at
            Rome during the New Year festivities of 1866, whereupon the
            government completely broke off all relations with the curia.
            Consequently in 1867 all the affairs of the Catholic church were
            committed to the clerical college at St. Petersburg, and
            intercourse between the clergy and the pope prohibited. Hence
            arose many conflicts with Catholic bishops, whose obstinacy was
            punished by their being interned in their dioceses. In 1869 the
            Russian calendar was introduced, and Russian made the compulsory
            language of instruction. But in 1870 greater opposition was
            offered to the introduction of Russian in the public services by
            means of translations of the common Polish prayer and
            psalm-books. Pietrowitsch, dean of Wilna, read from the pulpit
            the ukase referring to this matter, but then cast it <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page404">[pg 404]</span><a name="Pg404" id=
            "Pg404" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> together with the Russian
            translations into the flames, with violent denunciations of the
            government, and gave information against himself to the
            governor-general. He was agreeably to his own desire imprisoned,
            and then transported to Archangel. The same sentence was
            pronounced against several other obstinate prelates and clergy,
            among them Archbishop Felinsky, and thus further opposition was
            stamped out.—Leo XIII. soon after entering on his pontificate in
            1878 took the first step toward reconciliation. His efforts
            reached a successful issue first in February, 1883. The deposed
            prelates were restored from their places of banishment, with
            promise of a liberal pension, and were allowed to choose their
            residences as they pleased, only not within their former
            dioceses. In their stead the pope consecrated ten new bishops
            nominated by the emperor, who amid the jubilation of the people
            entered their episcopal residences. With reference to the Roman
            Catholic seminaries and clerical academies at Warsaw, the curia
            granted to the government the right of control over instruction
            in the Russian language, literature and history, but committed
            instruction in canonical matters solely to the bishops, who,
            after obtaining the approval of the government, appointed the
            rector and inspector and canonical teachers. Vacant pastorates
            were filled by the bishops, and only in the case of the more
            important was the approval of the government required. As to the
            language to be used, it was resolved that only where the people
            speak Russian were the clergy obliged to employ that language in
            preaching and in their pastoral work.</p>

            "font-style: italic">The Evangelical Church.</span></em>—The
            Lutheran church in Russia, comprising two and a half millions of
            Germans, Letts, Esthonians and Finns, is strongest in Livonia,
            Esthonia and Courland, is the national church in Finland, and is
            also largely represented in Poland, in the chief cities of
            Russia, and in the numerous German colonies in South Russia. In
            1832 it obtained, for the Baltic provinces and the scattered
            congregations in central Russia, a church constitution and
            service book, the latter on the basis of the old Swedish service
            book, the former requiring all religious teachers in church and
            school to accept the Formula of Concord. Annual provincial synods
            have the initiative in calling in, when necessary for legislative
            purposes, the aid of the general synod.—In Poland the Reformed
            and Lutheran churches were in 1828 united under one combined
            consistory. By an imperial ukase of 1849, however, the
            independent existence of both churches was restored. Protestants
            enjoyed all civil rights and had absolute liberty in the exercise
            of their religion; but in central Russia down to recent times,
            when a more liberal spirit began to prevail, they were prohibited
            putting bells in their churches. The old prohibition of
            evangelical preaching and the teaching of religion in the Russian
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page405">[pg 405]</span><a name=
            "Pg405" id="Pg405" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> tongue also
            continued; but the attempt made for some decades in St.
            Petersburg and the surrounding district to preach the gospel to
            Germans who had lost their mother tongue, in the Russian
            language, has been hitherto ungrudgingly allowed by the
            government. Quitting the national church or returning from it to
            a church that had been left before, is visited by severe
            penalties, and children of mixed marriages, where one parent
            belongs to the national orthodox church, are claimed by law for
            that church. Only Finland counts among her privileges the right
            of assigning children of mixed marriages to the church of the
            father. The Lutheran church in Livonia, with the island of Oesel,
            suffered considerable, and according to the law of the land
            irreparable, loss by the secession of sixty or seventy thousand
            Letts and Esthonians to the orthodox church under the widespread
            delusion that thereby their economic position would be improved.
            Disillusions and regret came too late, and the ever increasing
            desire for restoration to the church forsaken in a moment of
            excitement could only obtain arbitrary and insufficient
            satisfaction in Lutheran baptism of infants seemingly near death,
            and in permission at irregular intervals and without previous
            announcement to sit at the Lord's Table according to the Lutheran
            rite. In 1865, not indeed legislatively but administratively, the
            contracting of mixed marriages in the Baltic provinces was
            permitted without the enforcement of the legal enactment
            requiring that the children should be trained in the Greek
            church. In Esthonia, however, in 1883 there was a new outbreak of
            conversions in Leal, where five hundred peasants went over to the
            orthodox church, declaring their wish to be of the same faith as
            the emperor and the whole of the Russian people. By imperial
            decree in 1885 the suspension of the law against withdrawing
            again from the national church, which had existed for twenty
            years, was abolished. At the instigation of Pobedownoszew the
            Imperial Council granted an annual subsidy of 100,000 roubles for
            furthering orthodoxy in the Baltic provinces. No evangelical
            church could be built in these provinces without the approval of
            the orthodox bishop of the diocese, and any evangelical pastor
            who should dissuade a member of his church from his purpose of
            joining the orthodox church, was liable to punishment.—In order
            to supply the want of churches and schools, preachers and
            teachers in the Lutheran congregations of Russia, a society was
            formed in 1858 similar to the <span lang="de" class=

            civil independence. But the same princes representing all the
            three principal Christian confessions, who in 1830 gave their
            sanction to this emancipation within lamentably narrow limits, in
            1840 conquered again the Holy Land for the Turks out of the hands
            of a revolting vassal. And so inextricable were, and still are,
            the political interests of the Christian States of Europe with
            reference to the East, that in the London parliament of 1854 it
            could be affirmed that the existence of Turkey in a condition of
            utter impotence was so necessary, that if it did not exist, it
            would require to be created. On two occasions has Russia called
            out her whole military force to emancipate from the Turkish yoke
            her Slavic brethren of a common race and common faith, without
            being able to give the finishing blow to the <span class=

            Vienna Congress, the Greeks tried to deliver themselves from
            Turkish tyranny. In 1814 a <span lang="el" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Hetairia</span></span> was formed, branches
            of which spread over the whole land and fostered among the people
            ideas of freedom. The war of independence broke out in 1821. Its
            first result was a fearful massacre, especially in
            Constantinople. The patriarch Gregorius with his whole synod and
            about 30,000 Christians were in three months with horrid cruelty
            murdered by the Turks. The London Conference of 1830 at last
            declared Greece an independent state, and an assembly of Greek
            bishops at Nauplia in 1833 freed the national church of Greece
            from the authority of the patriarch of Constantinople, who was
            under the control of Turkey. Its supreme direction was committed
            to a permanent Holy Synod at Athens, instituted by the king but
            in all internal matters absolutely independent. The king must
            belong to the national church, but otherwise all <span class=

            footing. Meanwhile the orthodox church is fully represented, the
            Roman Catholic being strongest, especially in the islands. The
            University of Athens, opened in 1856 with professors mostly
            trained in Germany, has not been unsuccessful in its task even in
            the domain of theology.</p>

            of 1856, in which France and England, and latterly also Sardinia
            took the part of the sick man, left the condition of the
            Christians practically unchanged. For though the Hatti Humayun of
            1856 granted them equal civil rights with the Moslems, this,
            however well meant on the part of the Sultan of that time,
            practically made no improvement upon the equally well meant Hatti
            Sherif of Gülhane of 1839. The outbreak of 1860 also proved how
            little effect it had in teaching the Moslems tolerance towards
            the Christians. Roused by Jesuit emissaries and trusting to
            French support, the Maronites of Lebanon indulged in several
            provoking attacks upon their old hereditary foes the Druses.
            These, however, aided by the Turkish soldiery were always
            victorious, and throughout all Syria a terrible persecution
            against Christians of all confessions broke out, characterized by
            inhuman cruelties. In Damascus alone 8,000, in all Syria 16,000
            Christians were murdered, 3,000 women taken to the harems, and
            100 Christian villages destroyed. After the massacre had been
            stopped, 120,000 Christians wandered about without food,
            clothing, or shelter, and fled hither and thither in fear of
            death. Fuad Pasha was sent from Constantinople to punish the
            guilty, and seemed at first to proceed to business energetically;
            but his zeal soon cooled, and French troops, sent to Syria to
            protect the Christians, were obliged, yielding to pressure from
            England, where their presence was regarded with suspicion, to
            withdraw from the country in June, 1861.</p>

            of the language of the country, and had only one end in view,
            namely to recoup themselves by extorting the largest possible
            revenue. No thought was given to the spiritual needs of the
            Bulgarians, preaching was wholly abandoned, the liturgy was read
            in a language unknown to the people. It was therefore not to be
            wondered at that the Bulgarian church was for years longing for
            its emancipation and ecclesiastical independence, and made every
            effort to obtain this from the Porte. Turkey, however,
            sympathized with the patriarch till the revolt in Crete in
            1866-1869 and threatening political movements in <span class=

            last in 1870 the sultan granted the establishment of an
            independent Slavic ecclesiastical province under the designation
            of the Bulgarian Exarchate, with liberty to attach itself to the
            other Slavic provinces upon a two-thirds majority of votes. The
            patriarch Gregorius protested, but the Sublime Porte would not
            thereby be deterred, and in May, 1872, Anthimos the Exarch elect
            was installed. The patriarch and his synod now stigmatized
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            national church establishment, as accursed heresy, and
            excommunicated the exarch and the whole Bulgarian church. Only
            the patriarch Cyril of Jerusalem dissented, but he was on that
            account on his return home treated with indignity and abuse and
            was deposed by a synod at Jerusalem.</p>

            "font-style: italic">The Armenian Church.</span></em>—To the
            Gregorian-Armenian patriarch at Constantinople (§ 64, 3), equally
            with his orthodox colleague (§ 67, 7), had been assigned by the
            Sublime Porte civil jurisdiction as well as the primacy over all
            members of his church in the Turkish empire. When now in 1830, at
            the instigation of France, an independent patriarchate with equal
            rights was granted to the United Armenians (§ 72, 2), the twofold
            dependence on the Porte and on the Roman curia created
            difficulties, which in the meantime were overcome by giving the
            patriarch, who as a Turkish official exercised civil
            jurisdiction, a primacy with the title of archbishop as
            representative of the pope. The United Armenians, like the other
            united churches of the East, had from early times enjoyed the
            liberty of using their ancient liturgy, their old ecclesiastical
            calendar, and their own church constitution with free election of
            their bishops and patriarchs, and these privileges were left
            untouched down to 1866. But when in that year the Armenian
            Catholic patriarch died, the archbishop Hassun was elected
            patriarch, and then a fusion of the two ecclesiastical powers was
            brought about, which was expected to lead to absolute and
            complete subjection under papal jurisdiction and perfect
            assimilation with the Romish constitution and liturgy, at the
            same time Hassun with a view to securing a red hat showed himself
            eager and zealous in this business. By the bull <span lang="la"
            class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Reversurus</span></span> of 1867 Pius IX.
            claimed the right of nominating the patriarchs of all united
            churches of the East, of confirming bishops chosen by these
            patriarchs, in cases of necessity even choosing these himself,
            and deciding all appeals regarding church property. But the
            Mechitarists of St. Lazzaro (<a href="#Section_164_Para_2" class=
            "tei tei-ref">§ 164, 2</a>) had already discovered the intriguing
            designs of France and made these known among their countrymen in
            Turkey. These now, while Monsignore Hassun was engaged combating
            the infallibility dogma at the Vatican Council of 1870, drove out
            his creatures and constituted themselves into a church
            independent of Rome, without however, joining the
            Gregorian-Armenians. The influence of France <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page409">[pg 409]</span><a name="Pg409" id=
            "Pg409" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> being meanwhile crippled by
            the Prussian victory, the Porte acquiesced in the accomplished
            fact, confirmed the appointment of the newly chosen patriarch
            Kupelian, and refused to yield to the pope's remonstrances and
            allocutions. In 1874, however, it also recognised the Hassun
            party as an independent ecclesiastical community, but assigned
            the church property to the party of Kupelian, and banished Hassun
            as a fomenter of disturbance, from the capital. The hearty
            sympathies which on the outbreak of the Russo-Turkish war the
            Roman curia expressed so loudly and openly for the victory of the
            crescent over the schismatic Russian cross, made the Sublime
            Porte again regard the Hassunites with favour, so that Hassun in
            September, 1877, returned to Constantinople, where the churches
            were given over to his party and a great number of the
            Kupelianists were won over to his side. He was eagerly aided not
            only by the French but also by the Austrian ambassador, and the
            patriarch Kupelian, now sorely persecuted from every side, at
            last resigned his position and went in March, 1879, to Rome to
            kneel as a penitent before the pope. By an irade of the sultan,
            Hassun was now formally restored, and in 1880 he was adorned with
            a red hat by Leo XIII. Shortly before this the last of the
            bishops of the opposing party, with about 30,000 souls, had given
            in his submission.</p>

            drove the Christian states and tribes of the Balkan peninsula in
            1875 into a rebellion of desperation, which was avenged,
            especially in Bulgaria in 1876, by scandalous atrocities upon the
            Christians. When the half-hearted interference of European
            diplomacy called forth instead of actual reforms only the mocking
            sham of a pretended free representative constitution, Russia held
            herself under obligation in 1877 to avenge by arms the wrongs of
            her brethren by race and creed, but owing to the threats of
            England and Austria could not fully reap the fruits of her dearly

            1878 the principalities of Roumania, Servia, and Montenegro,
            hitherto under the suzerainty of Turkey, were declared
            independent, and to them, as well as to Greece, at the cost of
            Turkey, a considerable increase of territory was granted, the
            portion between the Balkans and the Danube was formed into the
            Christian principality of Bulgaria under Turkish suzerainty, but
            East Roumelia, south of the Balkans, now separated from Bulgaria,
            obtained the rank of an autonomous province with a Christian
            governor-general. To Thessaly, Epirus, and Crete were granted
            administrative reforms and throughout the European territory left

            of the United States of America, existing since the Declaration
            of Independence in 1776, and recognised by England as independent
            since the conclusion of Peace in 1783, requires of her citizens
            no other religious test than belief in one God. Since the
            settlers had often left their early homes on account of religious
            matters, the greatest variety of religious parties were gathered
            together here, and owing to their defective theological training
            and their practical turn of mind, they afforded a fruitful field
            for religious movements of all sorts, among which the revivals
            systematically cultivated by many denominations play a
            conspicuous part. The government does not trouble itself with
            religious questions, and lets every denomination take care of
            itself. Preachers are therefore wholly dependent on their
            congregations, and are frequently liable to dismissal at the
            year's end. Yet they form a highly respected class, and nowhere
            in the Protestant world is the tone of ecclesiastical feeling and
            piety so prevailingly high. In the public schools, which are
            supported by the State, religious instruction is on principle
            omitted. The Lutheran and Catholic churches have therefore
            founded parochial schools; the other denominations seek to supply
            the want by Sunday schools. The candidates for the ministry are

            Fathers who emigrated in 1620 (§ 143, 4). They profess the
            doctrines of the Westminster Confession (<a href=

            confession as the Congregationalists, but differ from them by
            having a common church government with strict Synodal and
            Presbyterial constitution. By rejecting the doctrine of
            predestination the Cumberland Presbyterians in 1810 formed a
            separate body and have since grown so as to embrace in the
            south-western states 120,000 communicants.—(3) <em class=

            and solid churchliness. Even here, however, Puseyism has entered
            in and the Romish church has made many proselytes. But when at
            the general conference of the Evangelical Alliance at New York in
            1873, bishop Cummins of Kentucky took part in the administration
            of the Lord's Supper in the Presbyterian church and was violently

            capable of improvement, while they recognise the ordinations of
            other evangelical churches as valid, and reject as Puseyite the
            doctrine of a special priesthood of the clergy, of a sacrifice in
            the eucharist, the presence of the body and blood of Christ in
            the elements, and of the essential and invariable connection

            life in the United States has been extraordinarily great. They
            have had by far the most to do with the revivals which from the
            first they have carried to a wonderful pitch with their
            protracted meetings, inquiry meetings, camp meetings, etc. They
            reached their climax in the camp meetings which, under the
            preaching mostly of itinerant Methodist preachers frequently in
            the forest under the canopy of heaven, produced religious
            awakening among the multitudes gathered from all around. Day and
            night without interruption they continued praying, singing,
            preaching, exhorting; all the horrors of hell are depicted, the
            excitement increases every moment, penitent wrestlings with
            sighs, sobs, groans, convulsions and writhings, occur on every
            side; grace comes at last to view; loud hallelujahs,
            thanksgivings and ascription of praise by the converted mix with

            wrote their names on a sheet in order to engage themselves for
            ever for Jesus. Since 1847 the Methodist church had been divided
            into two hostile camps, a southern and a northern. The first
            named tolerated slavery, while the members of the latter were
            decided abolitionists and excommunicated all slave-owners as
            unworthy of the name of Christian. Another party, the Protestant

            Denominations.</span></em>—The German emigration to America began
            in Penn's time. In the organization of church affairs, besides
            Zinzendorf and the Herrnhut missionaries, a prominent part was
            taken by the pastor Dr. Melchior Mühlenberg (died 1787), a pupil
            of A. H. Francke, and the Reformed pastor Schlatter from St.
            Gall; the former sent by the Halle Orphanage, the latter by the
            Dutch church. The Orphanage sent many earnest preachers till
            rationalism broke in upon the society. As at the same time the
            stream of German emigration was checked almost completely for
            several decades, and so all intercourse with the mother country
            ceased, crowds of Germans, impressed by the revivals, went over
            to the Anglo-American denominations, and in the German
            denominations themselves along with the English language entered
            also English Puritanism and Methodism. In 1815 German emigration
            began again and grew from year to year. At the synod of 1857 the
            Lutheran church with 3,000 pastors divided into three main
            divisions: (1) The American Lutheran church had become in
            language, customs, and doctrine thoroughly Anglicised and
            Americanized; Zwinglian in its doctrine of the sacraments, it was
            Lutheran in scarcely anything but the name, until in its chief
            seminary at Gettysburg in Pennsylvania in 1850 a reaction set in
            in favour of genuine Lutheran and German tendencies. (2) A
            greatly attenuated Lutheranism with unionistic sympathies and
            frequent abandonment of the German language also found expression
            in the congregations of the Old Pennsylvanian Synod. (3) On the
            other hand, the strict Lutheran church held tenaciously to the
            exclusive use of the German language and the genuine Lutheran
            confession. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page413">[pg
            413]</span><a name="Pg413" id="Pg413" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            The Prussian emigration with Grabau and the Saxon Lutheran
            settlers with Stephan constituted its backbone (<a href=
            "#Section_194_Para_1" class="tei tei-ref">§ 194, 1</a>). To them
            a number of Bavarian Lutherans attached themselves who had
            emigrated under the leadership of Löhe, whose missionary
            institute at Neuendettelsau supplied them with pastors. The Saxon
            Lutherans were meanwhile grouped together in the Missouri Synod,
            which Löhe's missionaries also joined, so that it soon acquired
            much larger proportions than the Buffalo Synod formed previously
            by the Prussian Lutherans under Grabau. But very soon the two
            synods had a violent quarrel over the idea of office and church
            which, owing to the reception by the Missouri Synod of several
            parties excommunicated by the Buffalo Synod, led to the formal
            breach of church fellowship between the two parties. The Missouri
            Synod, with Dr. Walther at its head, attached all importance to
            sound doctrine; the clerical office was regarded as a
            transference of the right of the congregation and excommunication
            as a congregational not a clerical act. The Buffalo Synod, on the
            other hand, in consequence of serious conflict with pietistic
            elements, had been driven into an overestimation of external
            order, of forms of constitution and worship, and of the clerical
            office as of immediately divine authority, and carried this to
            such a length as led to the dissolution of the synod in 1877.
            Löhe's friends, who had not been able to agree with either party,
            formed themselves into the Synod of Iowa, with their seminary at
            Wartburg under Fritschel. On all questions debated between the
            synods they took a mediating position. The Missourians, however,
            would have nothing to do with them, while those of Buffalo long
            maintained tolerably friendly relations with them. But the
            historical view of the symbols taken by the Iowans, their
            inclination toward the new development of Lutheran theology, and
            above all their attitude toward biblical chiliasm, which they
            wished to treat as an open question, seemed to those of Buffalo,
            as well as to the Missourians, a falling away from the church
            confession, and led to their excommunication by that party
            also.—In opposition to all this splitting up into sections a
            General Council of the Lutheran Church in America was held in
            1866, which sought to combine all Lutheran district synods, of
            which twelve, out of fifty-six, with 814 clergymen, joined it,
            Iowa assuming a friendly and Missouri a distinctly hostile
            attitude. The ninth assembly at Galesburg in Illinois in 1875
            laid down as its fundamental principle, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Lutheran pulpits only for Lutheran preachers, and
            Lutheran altars only for Lutheran communicants.”</span> The
            native Americans, however, insisted upon exceptions being
            allowed, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            Missouri Synod, embracing five synods, doctrinal controversies
            sprang up in 1860. A large number with Dr. Walther at their head
            held a strict doctrine of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">predestination</span></em> which they
            regarded as the mark of genuine Lutheranism. God has, they
            taught, chosen a definite number of men from eternity to
            salvation; these shall and must be saved. Salvation in Christ is
            indeed offered to all, but God secures it only for His elect, so
            that they are sure of it and cannot lose it again, not indeed
            <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "la"><span style="font-style: italic">intuitu fidei</span></span>
            but only according to His sovereign grace. Even one of the elect
            may seem temporarily to fall from grace, but he cannot die
            without returning into full possession of it. Prof. Fritschel
            protested against this in 1872 as essentially Calvinistic, and
            opposition also arose in the Missouri Pastoral Conference. Prof.
            Asperheim, of the seminary of the Norwegian Synod at Madison in
            Wisconsin, who first pronounced against it in 1876, was deprived
            of his office and obliged to withdraw from the synod. The
            controversy broke out in a violent form at the conferences of
            about 500 pastors held at Chicago in 1880 and at Milwaukee three
            months later in 1881, at the former of which Prof. Stellhorn of
            Fort Wayne, at the latter Prof. Schmidt of Madison, offered a
            vigorous opposition. Walther closed the conference with the
            words: <span class="tei tei-q">“You ask for war, war you shall
            have.”</span> The result was that the whole of the Ohio Synod and
            a large portion of the Norwegian Wisconsin Synod, broke away from
            communion with the Missouri Synod.—Walther and his adherents went
            so far in their fanaticism as to pronounce not only their
            American opponents but all the most distinguished Lutheran
            theologians of Germany, Philippi as well as Hofmann, Luthardt as
            well as Kahnis, Vilmar as well as Thomasius, Harms as well as
            Zöckler, etc., bastard theologians, semipelagians, synergists and
            rationalists, and to refuse church fellowship not only with all
            Lutheran national churches in Europe, but also with German
            Lutheran Free Churches, which did not unconditionally attach
            themselves to them. These Missouri separatist communities, though
            everywhere quite unimportant, are in Europe strongest in the
            kingdom of Saxony; they have also a few representatives in
            Nassau, Baden, Württemberg, Bavaria and Hesse.</p>

            English Catholics under Lord Baltimore settled in Maryland in
            1634. The little community grew and soon filled the land. There
            alone in the whole world did the Roman Catholic church though
            dominant proclaim the principle of toleration and religious
            equality. Consequently Protestants of various denominations
            crowded thither, outnumbered the original settlers, and rewarded
            those who had hospitably received them with abuse and oppression.
            The Catholics were also treated in other states as idolaters and
            excluded from public offices and posts of honour. Only after the
            Declaration of Independence in 1783 was this changed by the
            sundering of the connection of church and state and the
            proclamation of absolute religious liberty. The number of
            Catholics was greatly increased by numerous emigrations,
            specially from Ireland and Catholic Germany. They now claim seven
            million members, with a cardinal at New York, 13 archbishops, 64
            bishops, about 7,000 churches and chapels. A beautiful cathedral
            was erected in New York in 1879, the immense cost of which,
            exceeding all expectation, was at last defrayed by very
            unspiritual and unecclesiastical methods, <span class=

            Nowhere else was the influence and power of the clergy so
            wide-spread and deeply rooted, nowhere else has the depravation
            of Catholicism reached such a depth of superstition,
            obscurantism, and fanaticism. During the second and third decades
            of our <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page416">[pg

            century the Spanish states, favoured by the revolutionary
            movement in the mother country, one after another asserted their
            independence, and the Portuguese Brazil established herself as an
            independent empire under the legitimate royal prince of Portugal,
            Pedro I. in 1822. Although the other new states adopted a
            republican constitution, they could not throw aside the influence
            of the Catholic clergy and carry out the principles of religious
            freedom proclaimed in their constitutions. The Catholicism of the
            Creoles, half-castes, and mulattoes was of too bigoted a kind and
            the power of the clergy too great to allow any such thing. Mexico
            went furthest in the attempt, and Brazil, under Dom Pedro II.
            from 1831, astonished the world by the vigorous measures of its
            government in 1874 against the assumptions of the higher
            clergy.—In spite of all hindrances a not inconsiderable number of
            small evangelical congregations have been formed in Romish
            America, partly through emigration and partly by
            evangelization.</p>

            "font-style: italic">Mexico.</span></em>—Of all the American
            states, Mexico, since its independence in 1823, has been most
            disturbed by revolutions and civil wars. The rich and influential
            clergy, possessing nearly a half of all landed property, was the
            factor with which all pretenders, presidents and rulers had to
            reckon. After most of the earlier governments had supported the
            clergy and been supported by them, the ultimately victorious
            liberal party under president Juarez shook off the yoke in 1859.
            He proclaimed absolute religious freedom, introduced civil
            marriage, abolished cloisters, pronounced church possessions
            national property and exiled the obstinate bishops. The clerical
            party now sought and obtained foreign aid. Spain, France and
            England joined in a common military convention in 1861 in
            supporting certain claims of citizens repudiated by Juarez. Spain
            and England soon withdrew their troops, and Napoleon III. openly
            declared the purpose of his interference to be the strengthening
            of the Latin race and the monarchical principle in America. At
            his instigation the Austrian Grand-Duke Maximilian was elected
            emperor, and that prince, after receiving the pope's blessing in
            Rome, began his reign in 1864. Distrusted by all parties as a
            stranger, in difficulties with the curia and clergy because he
            opposed their claims to have their most extravagant <span class=

            shamefully left in the lurch by Napoleon from fear of the
            threatening attitude of the North American Union, and then sold
            and betrayed by his own general Bazaine, this noble but
            unfortunate prince was at last sentenced by Juarez at a
            court-martial to be shot in 1867. Juarez now maintained his
            position till the end of his life in 1872, and strictly carried
            out his anticlerical reforms. After his death clericalism again
            raised her head, and the Jesuits expelled from Guatemala swarmed
            over the land. Yet constitutional sanction was given to the
            Juarez legislation at the congress of 1873. The Jesuits were
            driven across the frontiers, obstinate priests as well as a great
            number of nuns, who had gathered again in cloisters and received
            novices, were put in prison.—Also <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Evangelization</span></em> advanced slowly
            under sanction of law, though regarded with disfavour by the
            people and interfered with often by the mob. It began in 1865
            with the awakening of a Catholic priest Francisco Aguilar and a
            Dominican monk Manuel Aguas, through the reading of the
            Scriptures. They laid the foundation of the <span class=

            evangelical doctrine and apostolic-episcopal constitution, which
            has now 71 congregations throughout the whole country with about
            10,000 souls. This movement received a new impulse in 1869, when
            a Chilian-born Anglican episcopal minister of a Spanish-speaking
            congregation in New York, called Riley, took the control of it
            and was in 1879 consecrated its bishop. Besides this independent

            government through almost incessant civil wars, religious freedom
            was generally proclaimed, civil marriage introduced, the Jesuits
            expelled, cloisters shut up, etc. But in <em class=

            by the clergy, concluded in 1862 a concordat with the curia by
            which throughout the country only the Catholic worship was
            tolerated, the bishops could condemn and confiscate any book,
            education was under the Jesuits, and the government undertook to
            employ the police in suppressing all errors and compelling all
            citizens to fulfil all their religious duties. And further the
            public resolved in 1873, although unable to pay the interest of
            the national debt, to hand over a tenth of all state revenues to
            the pope. But Moreno was murdered in 1875. The Jesuits, who were
            out of favour, left Quito. The tithe hitherto paid to the pope
            was immediately withheld, and in 1877 the concordat was
            abrogated. As Ecuador in Moreno, so <em class=

            at the same time in Pierola had a dictator after the pope's own
            heart. The republic had his misgovernment to thank for one defeat
            after another in the war with Chili.—<em class=

            suffered, in common with Peru, annihilating defeats at the hand
            of Chili.—When at St. Iago in Chili, during the festival of the
            Immaculate Conception in 1863, the Jesuit church La Compania was
            burnt and in it more than 2,000 women and children consumed, the
            clergy pronounced this disaster an act of grace of the blessed
            Virgin, who wished to give the country a vast number of saints
            and martyrs. But here, too, the conflicts between church and
            state continued. In 1874 the Chilian episcopate pronounced the
            ban against the president and the members of the national council
            and of the Lower House who had favoured the introduction of a new
            penal code which secured liberty of worship, but it remained
            quite unheeded. When then the archiepiscopal chair of St. Iago
            became vacant in 1878, the pope refused on any condition to
            confirm the candidate appointed by the government. After the
            decisive victory over Peru and Bolivia, the government again in
            December, 1881, urgently insisted upon their presentation. The
            curia now sent to Chili, avowedly to obtain more accurate
            information, an apostolic delegate who took advantage of his
            position to stir up strife, so that the government was obliged to
            insist upon his recall. As the curia declined to do so, his
            passports were sent to the legate in January, 1883, and a
            presidential message was addressed to the next congress which
            demanded the separation of the church and state, with the
            introduction of civil marriage and register of civil station, as
            the only remaining means for putting down the confusion caused by
            papal tergiversation. The result of the long and heated debates
            that followed was the promulgation of a law by which Catholicism
            was deprived of the character of the state religion and the
            perfect equality of all forms of worship was
            proclaimed.—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            Jesuits whose power and wealth had become very great. In 1874 the
            president Borrias opened a new campaign against the clergy by
            forbidding them to wear the clerical dress except when
            discharging the duties of their office, and closing all the
            nunneries.—In <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Venezuela</span></em>, in 1872, Archbishop
            Guevara of Caracas, who had previously come into collision with
            the government by favouring the rebels, forbade his clergy taking
            part in the national festival, and put the cathedral in which it
            was to be celebrated under the interdict. Deposed and banished on
            this account, he continued from the British island of Trinidad
            his endeavours to stir up a new rebellion. The president, Guzman
            Blanco, after long fruitless negotiations with the papal nuncio,
            submitted in May, 1876, to the congress at St. Domingo the draft
            of a bill, which declared the national church wholly independent
            of Rome. The congress not only homologated his proposals, but
            carried them further, by abolishing the episcopal hierarchy and
            assigning its revenues to the national exchequer, for education.
            Now at last the Roman curia <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page419">[pg 419]</span><a name="Pg419" id="Pg419" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> agreed to the deposition of Guevara and
            confirmed the nomination of his previously appointed successor.
            But president Blanco now asked congress to abolish the law, and
            this was agreed to.—In the United States of <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Colombia</span></em> since 1853, and in the
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Argentine Republic</span></em> since 1865,
            perfect liberty of faith and worship have been constitutionally
            secured. From the latter state the Jesuits had been banished for
            a long time but had managed to smuggle themselves in again. When
            in the beginning of 1875 Archbishop Aneiros of Buenos Ayres
            addressed to the government which favoured the clerical party
            rather than to the congress which was the only competent court, a
            request to reinvest the Jesuits with the churches, cloisters, and
            properties held by them before their expulsion, a terrible
            outbreak took place, which the archbishop intensified to the
            utmost by issuing a violent pastoral. A mob of 30,000 men,
            convened by the students of the university, wrecked the palace of
            the archbishop, then attacked the Jesuit college, burnt all its
            furniture and ornaments on the streets and by means of petroleum
            soon reduced the building itself to flames. Only with difficulty
            did the military succeed in preventing further mischief. In
            October, 1884, the papal nuncio was expelled, because, when the
            government decidedly refused his request to prevent the spread of
            Protestant teaching and to place Sunday schools under the
            oversight of the bishops, he replied in a most violent and
            passionate manner. About the same time the republic of <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Costa-rica</span></em> issued a law
            forbidding all religious orders, pronouncing all vows invalid,
            and threatening banishment against all who should contravene
            these enactments, and also an education act which forbade all
            public instruction apart from that provided by the State.</p>

            "font-style: italic">Brazil.</span></em>—In Brazil down to 1884,
            the <span class="tei tei-q">“Catholic Apostolic Roman
            Religion”</span> was, according to the constitution, the religion
            of the empire. But from 1828 there was a Protestant congregation
            in Rio de Janeiro, and through the inland districts, in
            consequence of immigration, there were 100 small evangelical
            congregations, with twenty-five ordained pastors, whose forms of
            worship were of various kinds. In earlier times Protestant
            marriage was regarded as concubinage, but in 1851 a law was
            passed which gave it civil recognition. But the bishops held to
            their previous views and demanded of married converts a
            repetition of the ceremony. Since 1870, however, the government
            has energetically opposed the claims of the clergy who wished
            only to acknowledge the authority of Rome. Protestant marriages
            were pronounced equally legitimate with Catholic marriages, no
            civil penalties are incurred by excommunication, all papal bulls
            are subject to the approval of the government, and it was
            insisted that announcement should be made of all clergy
            nominated. The clergy considered freemasonry the chief source of
            all this liberal current, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page420">[pg 420]</span><a name="Pg420" id="Pg420" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> and against it therefore they directed all
            their forces. The pope assisted by his brief of May, 1873,
            condemning freemasonry. At the head of the rebel prelates stood
            Don Vitalis Gonsalvez de Oliveira, bishop of Olinda and
            Pernambuco. He published the papal brief without asking the
            imperial permission, pronounced the ban upon all freemasons and
            suspended the interdict over all associations which refused to
            expel masonic brothers from their membership. In vain the
            government demanded its withdrawal. It then accused him of an
            attack upon the constitution. The supreme court ordered his
            detention, and he was placed in the state prison at Rio de
            Janeiro in January, 1874. The trial ended by his being sentenced
            to four years' imprisonment, which the emperor as an act of grace
            commuted to detention in a fortress, and set him free in a year
            and a half. In consequence of this occurrence the Jesuits were,
            in 1874, expelled from the country. The increasing advent of
            monks and nuns from Europe led the government, in 1884, to
            appoint a commission to carry out the law already passed in 1870,
            for the secularization of all monastic property after providing
            pensions for those entitled to support. In the same year all
            naturalized non-Catholics were pronounced eligible for election
            to the imperial parliament and to the provincial assemblies. The
            members belonging to the evangelical churches now number about
            50,000, of whom 30,000 are Germans.<a id="noteref_122" name=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It cannot be
            denied that since the Tridentine attempt to define the church
            doctrine far fewer sects condemning the church as such have
            sprung from Roman Catholicism than from Protestantism. Yet such
            phenomena are not wanting in the nineteenth century. Their
            scarcity is abundantly made up for by the numberless
            degenerations and errors (<a href="#Section_191" class=

            the higher and lower grades of the clergy not only fell into, but
            actually provoked and furthered, and thus encouraged an unhealthy
            love for religious peculiarities. Were the absence of new
            heretical, sectarian and fanatical developments something to be
            gloried in for itself alone, the Eastern church, with its
            absolute stability, would obtain this distinction in a far higher
            degree. In the Russian church, however, the multitude of sects
            which amid manifold oppressions and persecutions continue to
            exist to the present day, in spite of many persistent and even
            condemnable errors, witnesses to a deep religious need in the
            Russian people.</p>

            (<a href="#Section_172_Para_2" class="tei tei-ref">§ 172, 2</a>).
            Soon after their establishment in France the Jesuits sought to
            carry out their own hierarchical ideas. The fable of an
            uninterrupted connection between freemasonry as a <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“temple of humanity”</span> and the Templars of the
            Middle Ages, and the introduction therewith in their secret
            ceremonies of exercises, borrowed from the chivalry of romance,
            afforded a means toward this end. The idea was started in the
            Jesuit college at Claremont and was approved and accepted by the
            local lodge. In <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1754 a great number
            of their noble members, who were disgusted with the Jesuit
            templar farce, withdrew in order as <span class="tei tei-q">“New
            Templars”</span> to continue the old order in the spirit of
            modern times. In consequence, however, of the revolution that
            broke out in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1789 they could no
            longer hold their ground as a band of nobles. Napoleon favoured
            the reorganization of the order freed from those limits. The day
            of Molay's death (§ 112, 7) was publicly celebrated with great
            pomp in Paris, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1808 and the order
            spread among all French populations. On the Bourbon restoration
            the grand-master was, at the instigation of the Jesuits, cast
            into prison and the order suppressed. After the July revolution
            he was liberated and a new temple was opened in Paris in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1833. The
            show-loving Parisians for a long time took pleasure in the
            peculiar rites and costume of the templars. When this interest
            declined the order passed out of view. Its religion, which
            professed to be a primitive revelation carried down in the Greek
            and Egyptian mysteries, from which Moses borrowed, then further
            developed by Christ and transmitted in esoteric tradition by John
            and his successors the grand-masters of the templars, taught a
            divine <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page422">[pg

            trinity of being, act and consciousness, the eternity of the
            world alongside of God and an indwelling of God in man. It
            declared the Roman Catholic church to be the only true
            Christianity (<span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "fr"><span style="font-style: italic">église chrétienne

            apocryphal gospel of John in accordance with its own notions.—(2)

            school (<a href="#Section_174_Para_2" class="tei tei-ref">§ 174,
            2</a>) and he maintained intimate relations with his master all
            through life. In his later years he undertook by carrying his
            philosophical doctrine into the practical domain to sketch out a
            <span class="tei tei-q">“religion of humanity,”</span> and thus
            became the founder of a Positivist religious sect. The men of

            (Littré, Renan, Taine, Lewes, Leslie Stephens, Tyndall, Huxley,
            Draper, etc.), repudiate it; but in the middle and lower ranks
            some were found longing for an object of worship, who endeavoured
            on the basis of his <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign"

            (among whom Christ does not appear), while the weeks are named
            after lesser heroes. By the profound veneration of woman, which
            savours greatly of Mariolatry, as well as by the fantastic
            worship of heroes, geniuses and scholars, which is a mimicry of
            the popish saint worship, and by the adoption of a sacerdotalism
            like that of Catholicism, this religion of humanity shows itself
            to be an antichristian growth on Roman Catholic soil.</p>

            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Thomas
            Pöschl</span></em>, in the second decade of the century, presents
            an instance of a degeneration of originally pietistic tendencies
            into mischievous fanaticism. A Catholic priest at Ampfelwang near
            Linz, he sought under the influence of Sailer's mysticism to
            awaken in his congregation a more lively Christianity by means of
            prayer meetings and the circulation of tracts, in which he
            proclaimed the approaching end of the world. When the district in
            which he lived was, in 1814, attached to Austria, he was
            committed to prison, and his followers accepted as their leader
            the peasant <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Jos. Haas</span></em>, who led them further
            still into fanatical excesses. His fanaticism at length went so
            far that on Good Friday of 1817 a young maiden belonging to their
            party suffered a voluntary death after the example of Christ for
            her brothers and sisters. Pöschl professed the deepest horror at
            this cruel deed for which he was blamed. He died in close
            monastic confinement in 1837.—(5) The Antinomian sect of the
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Antonians</span></em>, most numerous in the
            Canton Bern, had its beginning among the Roman Catholics. Its
            founder was Antoni Unternährer, born and reared at Shüpfheim,
            near Lucerne, in the Catholic faith. From 1802 he resided at
            Amfoldingen, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page423">[pg
            423]</span><a name="Pg423" id="Pg423" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            near Thun, where he stood in high repute among the peasants as a
            quack doctor, gave himself out as the son of God a second time
            become man, and proclaimed by word and writing the perfect
            redemption from the curse of the law by the introduction of the
            true freedom of the sons of God, which was to show itself first
            of all in the absolutely unrestricted intercourse of the sexes.
            After two years' confinement in a house of correction he was
            banished from the Canton Bern and transported to his native
            place, where, abandoning all pastoral duties, he died in a police
            cell in 1814. The sect, which had meanwhile spread widely, and at
            Gsteig near Interlaken had obtained a new leader in the person of
            Benedict Schori, a third incarnation of Christ, could not be
            finally suppressed, notwithstanding the liberal use of the
            prison, till the beginning of 1840. Even at this day scattered
            remnants of Antonians are to be found in Canton Bern.—(6) When
            the Austrian constitution of 1849 gave unconditional religious
            toleration, the Bohemian <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Adamites</span></em> (§ 115, 5), of whom
            remnants under the mask of Catholicism had continued down to the
            nineteenth century, ventured again publicly to engage in
            proselytising efforts. An official enquiry instituted on this
            occasion declared that the sect, consisting of Bohemian peasants
            and artisans, had its headquarters among the mystics of the
            Krüdener school, that its religious doctrine was a mixture of
            communism, freethinking and quietism, and that its members were
            in their ordinary public life blameless, but that in their secret
            nightly assemblies, where they dispensed with clothes, they
            celebrated orgies regardless of marriage or relationship.—(7)
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">David
            Lazzaretti</span></em>, formerly a carrier in Tuscany, appeared
            in his native place after an absence of several years, in 1872,
            declaring that he was descended from a natural son of Charlemagne
            and had been entrusted by the Apostle Peter with a message to the
            pope, pointing to a cross that had been burnt upon his brow by
            the apostle himself. He startled those of the Vatican, where he
            was quite unknown, by declaring that the bones of his ancestors
            lay under the ruins of an old Franciscan cloister in Sabina, of
            whose existence nobody was aware, the discovery of which seemed
            to vouch for his claims. These were all the more readily admitted
            when it was found that he made the restoration of the Pope's
            temporal power his main task. The number of his adherents, mostly
            peasants, soon increased immensely, reaching, it is said, 40,000.
            On Monte Labro they built a church with a strong <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“David's Tower,”</span> over which <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“St. David”</span> appointed two priests who, when
            they had made certain changes in worship at the call of the
            prophet, were excommunicated by the bishop. David now began to
            spread his socialistic and communistic ideas. He insisted that
            his adherents should surrender their goods to him as
            representative of the society, and promised down to December
            31st, 1890, the introduction of community of goods throughout
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page424">[pg 424]</span><a name=

            afterwards in other countries. In Arcidosso, the prophet's
            birthplace, a beginning was to be made, but in its overthrow on
            August 18th, 1878, he met his death, and his befooled followers
            waited in vain for the fulfilment of his dying promise that he
            would rise again on the third day.</p>

            deaths, which had hitherto been without legal recognition, were
            put on the regular register and so their lawful rights of
            inheritance were secured. Under Alexander III. in 1883 an
            imperial decree was issued, which gave them permission to
            celebrate divine service after their own methods in their
            chapels, which had not before the legal standing of churches, and

            they had laid before him the confession which they had adopted,

            Taurus district. Under Nicholas I. they were to the number of
            3,000 transported to the Transcaucasian mountains in 1841, where

            abolition of serfdom in 1863. The originator of those separatist
            meetings for the study of Scripture, which led first of all to
            the condemnation of image worship and making the sign of the
            cross as unbiblical, and subsequently to a complete withdrawal
            from the worship of the orthodox church and the forming of
            conventicles, was the peasant and congregational elder Ratusny of
            Osnowa near Odessa, to whom, at a later period, with equal
            propagandist zeal, the peasant Balabok attached himself. The
            latter was, in 1871, sentenced to one year's imprisonment at Kiev
            and the loss of civil rights, and in 1873, at Odessa, a great
            criminal prosecution was instituted against Ratusny and all the
            other leaders of the sect, which, however, after proceeding for

            Filipow (<a href="#Section_163_Para_10" class="tei tei-ref">§
            163, 10</a>) had led many to abstain wholly from sexual
            relations; when a peasant Andrew Selivanov appeared as a reformer
            and founded the sect of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Skopzen</span></em> or mutilators, who,
            building on misinterpreted passages of Scripture (Matt. v. 28-30,
            xix. 12; Rev. xiv. 4) insisted upon the destruction of sexual
            desire by castration and excision of the female breasts,
            generally performed under anæsthetics, as a necessary condition
            of entrance into the kingdom of heaven. The first Skopzic
            congregation was gathered round him in the village of Sosnowka.
            The <span class="tei tei-q">“men of God”</span> enraged at his
            success denounced him to the government. He was punished with the
            knout and condemned in 1774 to hard labour at Irkutzk. The idea
            that Peter III., who died in 1762, was still alive, then widely
            prevailed. The <span class="tei tei-q">“men of God”</span> had
            also adopted this opinion, and proclaimed him their
            last-appearing Christ, who would soon return from his
            hiding-place to call to account all unbelievers. Selivanov, who
            knew of this, now gave himself out for the exiled monarch, and
            was accepted as such by his adherents in his native place. When
            Paul I., Peter's son, assumed the reins of government in 1796, a
            Skopzic merchant of Moscow told him secretly that his father was
            living at Irkutzk under the name of Selivanov. The emperor
            therefore brought him to Petersburg and shut him up as an
            imbecile in an asylum. After Paul's death, however, his adherents
            obtained his release. He now lived for eighteen years in honour
            at Petersburg, till in 1820 the court again interfered and had
            him confined in a cloister at Suzdal, where after some years he
            died. Sorely persecuted by Nicholas I. many of his followers
            migrated to Moldavia and Walachia where they, dwelling in
            separate quarters at Jassy, Bucharest and Galatz, lived as owners
            of coach-hiring establishments, and by rich presents obtained
            proselytes. Still more vigorously was the propaganda carried on
            in the Moscow colonies on the Sea of Azov. There in Morschansk
            lived the spiritual head of all Russian Skopzen, the rich
            merchant Plotizyn. After the government got on the track of this
            society, Plotizyn's house was searched and a correspondence
            revealing the wide extension of the sect was found, together with
            a treasure of several, some say as much as thirty, millions of
            roubles, which, however, in great part again disappeared in a
            mysterious manner. Plotizyn and his companions were banished to
            Siberia and sentenced to hard labour, the less seriously
            implicated to correction in a cloister.—The secret doctrine of
            the Skopzen so far as is known is as follows: God had intended
            man to propagate not by sexual intercourse but by a holy kiss.
            They broke this command and this constituted the fall. In the
            fulness of time God sent his Son into the world. The central
            point of his preaching transmitted to us in a greatly distorted
            form was the introduction of the baptism of fire <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page426">[pg 426]</span><a name="Pg426" id=
            "Pg426" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> (Matt. iii. 11), <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>
            mutilation by hot irons for which, in consideration of human
            weakness, a baptism of castration may be substituted (Matt. xix.
            12). Origen is regarded by them as the greatest saint of the
            ancient church; to his example all saints conformed who are
            represented as beardless or with only a slight beard. The
            promised return of the Christ (in this alone diverging from the
            doctrine of the <span class="tei tei-q">“men of God”</span>),
            took place in the person of the emperor Peter III. whom an
            unstained virgin bore, who was called the empress Elizabeth
            Petrovna. The latter after some years transferred the government
            to a lady of the court resembling her and retired into private
            life under the name of Akulina Ivanovna, where she still remains
            invisible behind golden walls, waiting for the things that are to
            come. Her son Peter III., who had also himself undergone the
            baptism of fire, escaped the snares of his wife, reappeared under
            the name of Selivanov, performed many miracles and converted
            multitudes, obtained as a reward the knout, and was at last sent
            to Siberia. Emperor Paul recalled him and was converted by him.
            Under Alexander I. he was again arrested and imprisoned in the
            cloister of Suzdal. But he was conveyed thence by a divine
            miracle to Irkutzk, where he now lives in secret, whence at his
            own time he shall return to judge the living and the dead.—They
            kept up an outward connection with the state church although they
            regarded it as the apocalyptic whore of Babylon. In their own
            secret services inspired psalms were sung, and after exciting
            dances prophecies were uttered.<a id="noteref_123" name=

            States of America with their peculiar constitution formed the
            favourite ground for the gathering and moulding of sects during
            this age. There, besides the older colonies of Quakers, Baptists
            and Methodists from England, we meet with Swedenborgianism and
            Unitarianism, while Baptists and Methodists began to send
            missionaries into Europe, and from England the Salvation Army
            undertook a campaign for the conquest of the world. But also on
            the European continent independent fanatical developments made
            their appearance.—A new combination of communism <span class=

            represented by the Harmonists and by the Perfectionists in North
            America. The Grusinian Separatists and the Bavarian Chiliasts are
            millenarians of German extraction, of whom the former sought
            deliverance from the prevailing antichristian spirit in removal
            from, and the latter in removal to, South Russia. The Amen
            churches sought to gather God's people of the Jewish Christian
            communities together in Palestine, while the so-called German
            Temple sought to gather the Gentile Christians. As Latter Day
            Saints, besides the Adventists, the Darbyites established
            themselves on an independent basis; the Irvingites, with revival
            of the apostolic offices and charisms, and their American
            caricature, the Mormons, with the addition of socialistic and
            fantastic gnostic tendencies. The religion of the Taiping
            rebellion in China presented the rare phenomenon of a national
            Chinese Christianity of native growth, and a still rarer
            manifestation is met with in American-European spiritualism with
            pretended spirit revelations from the other world.</p>

            Episcopal Methodists, have sent out numerous missionaries, mostly
            Germans into Germany, whose zeal has won considerable success
            among the country people. In North-West Germany Bremen is their
            chief station, whence they have spread to Sweden, Central and
            Southern Germany, and Switzerland, and have stations in
            Frankfort, Carlsruhe, Heilbronn, and Zürich.—Of a more evanescent
            character was the attempt made on Germany by the so-called
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Oxford
            Holiness Movement</span></em>. In 1866 the North American
            Methodists celebrated their centenary in New York by the
            appointment of a great revival and holiness committee, in which
            were also members of many other denominations. Among them the
            manufacturer, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Pearsall Smith</span></em>, of Philadelphia,
            converted in 1871, exhibited extraordinary zeal. In September,
            1874, he held at Oxford great revival meetings, from which the
            designation of the Oxford movement had its origin. By some
            Germans there present his opinions were carried to Germany. In
            spring, 1875, he began his second European missionary tour. While
            his two companions, the revivalists Moody and Sankey, travelled
            through England for the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page428">[pg

            conversion of the masses, Smith went to Germany, and proceeding
            from Berlin on to Switzerland, gave addresses in English, that
            were interpreted, in ten of the large cities. The most pious
            among clergy and laity flocked from far and near to hear him. The
            new apostle's journey became more and more a triumphal march. He
            was lauded as a reformer called to complete the work of Luther;
            as a prophet, who was to fructify the barren wastes of Germany
            with the water of life. The core of his doctrine was: Perfect
            holiness and the attainment of absolute perfection, not
            hereafter, but now! now! now! with the constant refrain:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Jesus saves me now</span></em>”</span>; not
            remission of sins through justification by faith in the atoning
            efficacy of Christ's blood, which only avails for outward sinful
            actions, but immediate extinction of sins by Christ in us, proved
            in living, unfaltering, inner, personal experience, etc. By a
            great international and interconfessional meeting at Brighton,
            lasting for ten days, in June, 1875, at which many German
            pastors, induced by the payment of travelling expenses, were
            present, the crown was put upon the work. But at the height of
            his triumph, under the daily increasing tension and excitement
            the apostle of holiness showed himself to be a poor sinful son of
            man, for he strayed into errors, <span class="tei tei-q">“if not
            practically, at least theoretically,”</span> which his admirers
            at first referred to mental aberration, but which they hid from
            the eyes of the world under a veil of mystery. Toward the end of
            the Brighton conference he declared to his hearers: <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Thus plunge into a life of divine unconcern!”</span>
            and, <span class="tei tei-q">“All Europe lies at my feet.”</span>
            And in subsequent private conversations he developed a system of
            ethics that <span class="tei tei-q">“would suit Utah rather than
            England,”</span> to which he then so conformed his own conduct
            that his admirers, <span class="tei tei-q">“although satisfied of
            the purity of his own intentions,”</span> were obliged
            energetically to repudiate and with all speed send away across

            deceived.</p>

            attained its greatest success in England. Its numerous
            <span class="tei tei-q">“prisoners of war”</span> from the
            devil's army (prostitutes, drunkards, thieves, etc.) are led at
            the parade as trophies of war, and tell of their conversion,
            whereupon the command of the general, <span class=

            hallelujahs. Liberal collections and unsought contributions,
            embracing several donations of a £1,000 and more, are given to
            the General, not only to pay his soldiers, but also to rent or to
            purchase and fit up theatres, concert halls, circuses, etc., for
            their meetings, and to build large new <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“barracks.”</span> Its wonderful success has secured
            for the army many admirers and patrons, even in the highest ranks
            of society. Queen Victoria herself testified to Mrs. Booth her
            high satisfaction with her noble work. At the Convocation, too,
            in the Upper as well as the Lower House, distinguished prelates
            spoke favourably of its methods and results, and so encouraged
            the formation of a Church Army, which, under the direction of the
            mission preacher Aitken, pursues similar ways to those of the
            Salvation Army, without, however, its spectacular displays, and
            has lately extended its exertions to India. The temperance party
            after the same model has formed a Blue Ribbon Army, the members
            of which, distinguished by wearing a piece of blue ribbon in the
            buttonhole, confine themselves to fighting against alcohol. In
            opposition to it public-house keepers and their associates formed
            a Yellow Ribbon Army, which has as its ensign the yellow silk
            bands of cigar bundles. Soon after the first great success of the
            Salvation Army, a Skeleton Army was formed out of the lowest
            dregs of the London mob, which, with a banner bearing the device
            of a skeleton, making a noise with all conceivable instruments,
            and singing obscene street songs to sacred melodies, interrupted
            the marches of the Salvation, and afterwards of the Church, Army:
            throwing stones, filthy rotten apples and eggs, and even storming
            and demolishing their <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“barracks.”</span>—In 1880 a detachment of the
            Salvation Army, with Railton at its head, assisted by seven
            Hallelujah Lasses, made a first campaign in America, with New
            York as its head-quarters. In the following year, under Miss
            Booth, it invaded France, where it issues a daily bulletin,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign"
            xml:lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">En
            Avant</span></span>.”</span> In 1882 it appeared in Australia,
            then in India, where Chunder Sen, the founder of the Brama-Somaj,
            showed himself favourable. In Switzerland it broke ground in
            1882, in Sweden in 1884, and in Germany, at Stuttgart, in
            November, 1886. Africa, Spain, Italy, etc., followed in
            succession. These foreign corps <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            success. Almost everywhere they met with opposition, the
            magistrates often forbidding their meetings, and inflicting fines
            and imprisonment, and the mob resorting to all sorts of violent
            interference. Nowhere were both sorts of opponents so persistent
            as in Switzerland in 1883 and 1884, especially in Lausanne,
            Geneva, Neuenburg, Bern, Beil, etc. Although General Booth
            himself at the annual meeting in April, 1884, boasted that
            £393,000 had been collected during the past year for the purposes
            of the army, and over 846 barracks in eighteen countries of the
            world had been opened, and now even spoke of strengthening the
            army by establishing a Salvation Navy, the increasing
            extravagances caused by the army itself, as well as the far
            greater improprieties of those more or less associated with it,
            has drawn away many of its former supporters.</p>

            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Baptist</span></em> sympathies and
            tendencies often appeared in Germany apart from an
            anti-ecclesiastical pietism or mysticism. But this aberration
            first assumed considerable proportions when a Hamburg merchant,
            Oncken, who had been convinced by his private Bible reading of
            the untenableness of infant baptism, was baptized by an American
            baptist in 1834, and now not only founded the first German
            baptist congregation in Hamburg, but also proved unwearied in his
            efforts to extend the sect over all Germany and Scandinavia by
            missions and tract distribution. Oncken died in 1884. Thus
            gradually there were formed about a hundred new Baptist German
            congregations in Mecklenburg, Brandenburg (Berlin), Pomerania,
            Silesia, East Prussia (Memel, Tilsit, etc.), Westphalia,
            Wupperthal, Hesse, Württemberg and Switzerland. In Sweden (250
            congregations with 18,000 souls) they were mainly recruited from
            the <span class="tei tei-q">“Readers,”</span> who after 1850 went
            over in crowds (<a href="#Section_201_Para_2" class=
            "tei tei-ref">§ 201, 2</a>). They also found entrance into
            Denmark and Courland, but in all cases almost exclusively among
            the uncultured classes of labourers and peasants. After long but
            vain attempts at suppression by the governments during the
            reactionary period of 1850, they obtained under the liberal
            policy of the next two decades more or less religious toleration
            in most states. They called themselves the society of
            <span class="tei tei-q">“baptized Christians,”</span> and
            maintained that they were <span class="tei tei-q">“the visible
            church of the saints,”</span> the chosen people of God, in
            contrast to the <span class="tei tei-q">“hereditary church and
            the church of all and sundry,”</span> in which they saw the
            apocalyptic Babylon. Even the Mennonites who <span class=

            they regard as a <span class="tei tei-q">“hereditary”</span>
            church. With the Anglo-American Baptists they do indeed hold
            fellowship, but take exception to them in several points,
            especially about open communion.—A peculiar order of Baptists has
            arisen in Hungary in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Followers of Christ.”</span> Founded in
            1840 by Louis Henefey originally a Catholic smith, who had
            returned home from Switzerland, the sect obtained numerous
            adherents from all three churches, most largely from the Reformed
            church, favoured perhaps by the not yet altogether extinguished
            reminiscences of the Baptist persecutions of the eighteenth
            century (<a href="#Section_163_Para_2" class="tei tei-ref">§ 163,
            2</a>). They practised strict asceticism, refused to take oaths
            or engage in military service, and kept the bare Puritan forms of
            worship, in which any one was allowed to preach whom the Holy
            Spirit enlightened. Their congregations embraced weak and strong
            friends, and also weak and strong brethren. The strong friends
            after receiving baptism joined the ranks of weak brethren, and
            then again became strong brethren on their admission to the
            Lord's Supper. The church officers were singers, teachers,
            evangelists, elders, and bishops.—In North America <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Quakerism</span></em>, under the influence
            of increasing material prosperity, had lost much of its primitive
            strictness in life and manners. The more lax were styled
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Wet-</span></em>, and their more rigorous
            opponents <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Dry-Quakers</span></em>. Enthusiasm over the
            American War of Independence of 1776-1783, spreading in their
            ranks, led to further departures from the rigid standard of early
            times. Those who took weapons in their hands were designated
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Fighting Quakers</span></em>. The General
            Assembly disapproved but tolerated these departures; neither the
            Wet nor the Fighting Quakers were excommunicated, but they were
            not allowed any part in the government of the community. In 1822
            a party appeared among them, led by Elias Hicks, which carried
            the original tendency of Quakerism to separate itself from
            historical Christianity so far as to deny the divinity of Christ,
            and to allow no controlling authority to Scripture in favour of
            the unrestricted sway of reason and conscience. This departure
            from the traditions of Quakerism, however, met with vigorous
            opposition, and the protesting party, known as <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Evangelical
            Friends</span></em>, pronounced more decidedly than ever for the
            authority of Scripture. In England, notwithstanding the wealth
            and position of its adherents, Quakerism, since the second half
            of the eighteenth century, has suffered a slow but steady
            decrease, while even in America, to say the least, no advance can
            be claimed. In Holland, Friesland, and Holstein, Quaker
            missionaries had found some success among the Mennonites,
            without, however, forming any separate communities. In 1786 some
            English Quakers succeeded in winning a small number of proselytes
            in Hesse, who in 1792, under the protection of the prince of
            Waldeck, formed a little congregation at Friedersthal, near
            Pyrmont, which still maintains its existence.—On the sects of

            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Swedenborgianism</span></em> has found many
            adherents. In England, Scotland and North America the sect has
            founded many missionary and tract societies. In Württemberg the
            procurator Hofacker and the librarian Tafel, partly by editions
            and translations of the writings of Swedenborg, partly by their
            own writings, were specially zealous in vindicating and spreading
            their views. A general conference of all the congregations in
            Great Britain and Ireland in 1828 published a confession of faith
            and catechism, and thirteen journals (three English, seven
            American, Tafel's in German, one Italian and one Swedish)
            represent the interests of the party. The liberal spirit of
            modern times has in various directions introduced modifications
            in its doctrine. Its Sabellian opposition to the church doctrine
            of the Trinity and its Pelagian opposition to the doctrine of
            justification, have been retained, and its spiritualising of
            eschatological ideas has been intensified, but the theosophical
            magical elements have been wholly set aside and scarcely any
            reference is ever made to revelations from the other world.—From
            early times the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Unitarians</span></em> had a well ordered
            and highly favoured ecclesiastical institution in Transylvania
            (<a href="#Section_163_Para_1" class="tei tei-ref">§ 163, 1</a>).
            But in England the law still threatened them with a death
            sentence. This law had not indeed for a long time been carried
            into effect, and in 1813 it was formally abrogated. There are now
            in England about 400 small Unitarian congregations with some
            300,000 souls. The famous chemist Jos. Priestly may be regarded
            as the founder of North American Unitarianism (<a href=
            "#Section_171_Para_1" class="tei tei-ref">§ 171, 1</a>), although
            only after his death in 1804 did the movement which he
            represented spread widely through the country. Then in a short
            time hundreds of Unitarian congregations were formed. Their most
            celebrated leaders were W. Ellery Channing, who died in 1842, and
            Theodore Parker, who died in 1860, both of Boston.</p>

            came forth with her prophecies. Her followers, the <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">New
            Israelites</span></em> or Sabbatarians, so called because they
            observed the Old Testament law of the Sabbath, founded a chapel
            in London for their worship. A beautiful cradle long stood ready
            to receive the promised Messiah, but Johanna died in 1814 without
            giving birth to him.—A horrible occurrence, similar to that
            recorded in <a href="#Section_210_Para_2" class="tei tei-ref">§
            210, 2</a>, took place some years later, in 1823, in the village
            of Wildenspuch in Canton Zürich. <em class=

            visions in early youth, was on this account expelled from Canton
            Aargau, and was carried still farther in the direction of extreme
            mysticism by the vicar John Ganz, by whom she was introduced to
            Madame de Krüdener (<a href="#Section_176_Para_2" class=
            "tei tei-ref">§ 176, 2</a>). Amid continual <span class=

            "Pg433" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> heavenly visions and
            revelations, as well as violent conflicts with the devil and his
            evil spirits, she gathered a group of faithful followers, by whom
            she was revered as a highly gifted saint, among them a melancholy
            shoemaker, Morf, whom Ganz introduced to her. The spiritual love
            relationship between the two in an unguarded hour took a sensual
            form and led to the birth of a child, which Morf's forbearing
            wife after successfully simulating pregnancy adopted as her own.
            This deep fall, for which she wholly blamed the devil, drove her
            fanaticism to madness. The ridiculous proceedings in her own
            house, where for a whole day she and her adherents beat with
            fists and hammers what they supposed to be the devil, led the
            police to interfere. But before orders arrived from Zürich, she
            found refuge in an asylum, and there the end soon came. Margaret
            assured her followers that in order that Christ might fully
            triumph and Satan be overthrown, blood must be shed for the
            salvation of many thousand souls. Her younger sister Elizabeth
            voluntarily allowed herself to be slain, and she herself with
            almost incredible courage allowed her hands and feet to be nailed
            to the wood and then with a stroke of the knife was killed, under
            the promise that she as well as her sister should rise again on
            the third day. The tragedy ended by the apprehension and long
            confinement of those concerned in it.—The sect of <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Springers</span></em> in Ingermannland had
            its origin in 1813. Arising out of a religious excitement not
            countenanced by the church authorities, they held that each
            individual needed immediate illumination of the Holy Spirit for
            his soul's salvation. So soon as they believed that this was
            obtained, the presence of the Spirit was witnessed to by ecstatic
            prayer, singing and shouting joined with handshaking and
            springing in their assemblies. The special illumination required
            as its correlate a special sanctification, and this they sought
            not only in repudiation of marriage, but also in abstinence from
            flesh, beer, spirits and tobacco. The <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“holy love,”</span> prized instead of marriage,
            however, here also led to sensual errors, and the result was that
            many after the example of the Skopzen (<a href=
            "#Section_210_Para_4" class="tei tei-ref">§ 210, 4</a>) resorted
            to the surer means of castration.—Among the Swedish peasants in
            1842 appeared the singular phenomenon of the <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Crying
            Voices</span></em> (<span lang="sv" class="tei tei-foreign"
            xml:lang="sv"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Röstar</span></span>). Uneducated laymen,
            and more particularly women and even children, after convulsive
            fits broke out into deep mutterings of repentance and
            prophesyings of approaching judgment. The substance of their
            proclamations, however, was not opposed to the church doctrine,
            and the criers were themselves the most diligent frequenters of
            church and sacrament.—In the beginning of 1870 the wife of a
            settler at Leonerhofe, near San Leopoldo in Brazil, <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Jacobina
            Maurer</span></em>, became famous among the careless colonists of
            that region as a pious miracle-working prophetess. In religious
            assemblies which she originated, she gave forth her fantastic
            revelations based upon <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page434">[pg
            434]</span><a name="Pg434" id="Pg434" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            allegorical interpretations of Scripture, and founded a
            congregation of the <span class="tei tei-q">“elect”</span> with a
            communistic constitution, in which she assumed to herself all
            church offices as the Christ come again. Rude abuse and
            maltreatment of these <span class="tei tei-q">“Muckers”</span> on
            the part of the <span class="tei tei-q">“unbelieving,”</span> and
            the interference of the police, who arrested some of the more
            zealous partisans of the female Christ, brought the fanaticism to
            its utmost pitch. Jacobina now declared it the duty of believers
            to prepare for the bliss of the millennium by rooting out all the
            godless. Isolated murders were the prelude of the night of
            horror, June 25th-26th, 1874, on which well organized
            Mucker-bands, abundantly furnished with powder and shot, went
            forth murdering and burning through the district for miles
            around. The military sent out against them did not succeed in
            putting down the revolt before August 2nd, after the prophetess
            with many of her adherents had fallen in a fanatically brave
            resistance.</p>

            only soil upon which these could flourish was that of the Free
            States of North America. Besides the small Shaker communities
            (<a href="#Section_170_Para_7" class="tei tei-ref">§ 170, 7</a>)
            still surviving in 1858, the following new fraternities are the
            most important: 1. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Harmonites</span></em>. The dissatisfaction
            caused among the Württemberg Pietists by the introduction of
            liturgical innovations led to several migrations in the beginning
            of the century. Geo. Rapp, a simple peasant from the village of
            Iptingen, went to America in 1803 or 1804 with about six hundred
            adherents, and settled in the valley of Connoquenessing, near
            Pittsburg in Pennsylvania. As a fundamental principle of this
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Harmony Association,”</span> which
            honoured father Rapp as autocratic patriarch, prophet and high
            priest, and with him believed in the near approach of the second
            advent, the community of goods holds a prominent place. By
            diligence and industry in agriculture, labour and manufactures,
            they reached great prosperity under the able leadership of their
            patriarch. In 1807 the community, by a resolution of its own to
            which Rapp agreed, resolved to abstain from marriage, so that
            henceforth no children were born nor marriages performed. A
            falling off in numbers was made up in 1817 by new arrivals from
            Württemberg and afterwards by the adoption of children.
            Industrial reasons led the community in 1814 to colonize
            Wabashthal in Indiana, where they built the town of Harmony,
            which, however, in 1823, on account of its unhealthy situation,
            they sold to the Scotchman Robert Owen (<a href=
            "#Section_212_Para_3" class="tei tei-ref">§ 212, 3</a>), and then
            founded for themselves the town of Economy, not far from
            Pittsburg, where they still reside. In 1831 an adventurer,
            Bernard Müller, appeared among them, who, at Offenbach, had, for
            a long time, under the name of Proli, played a brilliant part as
            a prophet called to establish universal spiritual monarchy, and
            then, when in danger from the courts of law, had fled to America.
            In Economy, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page435">[pg
            435]</span><a name="Pg435" id="Pg435" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            where he passed himself off as Count Maximilian von Leon,
            persecuted on account of his belief in the second coming, he
            found as such a hearty welcome, and within a year, by his
            agitation for the reintroduction of marriage and worldly
            enjoyments, drew away a third part of the community, embracing
            250 souls. The dissentients with 105,000 dollars from the common
            purse withdrew and settled under the leadership of the
            pseudo-count as a New Jerusalem society in the neighbouring
            village of Philippsburg. But the new patriarch conducted himself
            so riotously that he was obliged in 1833 to flee to Louisiana,
            where in the same year he died of cholera. His people now in deep
            distress turned to Dr. Keil, a mystic come from Prussia, who
            reorganised them after the pattern of Rapp's communistic society,
            but with liberty to marry, and brought them to a prosperous
            condition in two colonies mainly founded by him at Bethel in
            Missouri and Aurora in Oregon. Economy, too, flourished in spite
            of the heavy losses it sustained, so that now the common property
            of the populace, which through celibacy had been reduced to about
            eighty persons, amounts to eight million dollars. Father Rapp
            died in 1847, in his ninetieth year, confident to the end that he
            would guide his church unto the hourly expected advent of
            Christ.—2. When in 1831 a wave of revival passed over North
            America, J. H. Noyes, an advocate's assistant, applied himself to
            the study of the Bible and became the founder of a new sect, the
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible
            Communists</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Perfectionists</span></em> of the Oneida
            Society. He taught that the promised advent of Christ took place
            spiritually soon after the destruction of Jerusalem; by it the
            kingdom of Adam was ended and the kingdom of God in the heart of
            those who knew and received him was established. The official
            churches were only state churches, but the true church was
            scattered in the hearts of individual saints, until Noyes
            collected and organized it into a Bible family. For them there is
            no more law, for laws are for sinners and the saints no longer
            sin. Each saint can do and suffer whatever the Spirit of God
            moves him to. All the members of the congregation constitute one
            family, live, eat, and work together. Goods, wives and children
            are in common. It lies with the wife to accept or refuse the
            approaches of a man. But soon this proclaimed freedom from law
            sent everything into confusion and disunion; schism—apostasy
            prevailed. But Father Noyes now saved his church from destruction
            by introducing a correction to this freedom from law in
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Sympathy</span></em>, <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>
            in the agreement of all members of the family. The odium which
            fell upon the community from without on account of its
            <span class="tei tei-q">“complex marriages,”</span> induced him
            at last in August, 1879, although he still always maintained the
            soundness of his principle of free love and its final victory
            over prejudice, to ordain the introduction of monogamic
            marriages, and the community acquiesced. With <span class=

            meals and children, however, they kept to the old lines. The
            parent community has its seat at Lenox in Oneidabach in New York
            State. Alongside of it are three daughter communities. They have
            their prophets and prophetesses, but no ritual service and no
            Sunday. Their employment (they number about 300 souls) is mainly
            fruit culture and the manufacture of snares of every kind for
            wild and other animals.<a id="noteref_125" name="noteref_125"

            Separatists</span></em>. The stream of Württemberg emigrants
            above referred to turned also toward Southern Russia. The
            settlers in Transcaucasian Georgia in the long absence of regular
            pastors fell into fanatical separation, which the clergy who
            followed in 1820 could not overcome. Under the direction of three
            elders (one of them an old woman) as representing the Holy
            Trinity, they lived quietly, refused to baptize their children,
            to give their dead burial according to the rites of the church,
            to call in physicians in sickness, and at last rejected the
            marriage relation. In 1842 their female elder, Barbara Spohn,
            wife of a cartwright, appeared in the rôle of a prophet,
            proclaiming the near approach of the end of the world and calling
            upon her followers to pass through the wilderness to the promised
            land, there to enter into the millenial kingdom. They were to
            take with them no money, no bread, etc., but only a staff; their
            clothes and shoes would not wear old in the desert, they could
            eat manna and quails, and in the holy land Christ would dress
            them in the bridal robe. The government sought in vain to bring
            them to reason and to obstruct their way, when about three
            hundred of them wished at Pentecost, 1843, to start on their
            journey. They were allowed to send three men to Constantinople
            and Palestine to seek permission from the Turkish government to
            settle in a spot near Jerusalem. But these returned before the
            close of the year with the news, that Palestine is not the land
            that would suit them. This brought the majority to their senses
            and they rejoined the church.—2. Equally unfortunate was the
            attempt at colonization made in 1878 by some <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Bavarian
            Chiliasts</span></em>. The pastor Clöter in Illenschwang had for

            him, urged the emigration of believers to South Russia, where,
            according to his exposition of the apocalyptic prophecy, a secure
            place of refuge had been provided by God for believers of the
            last times during the near approaching persecutions of
            antichrist. In June, 1878, the tailor Minderlein with his family
            and nineteen other persons started to go <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page437">[pg 437]</span><a name="Pg437" id="Pg437" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> thither. Minderlein died by the way, and
            his companions after enduring great hardships were obliged to
            return, and reached Nuremberg again in October, absolutely
            destitute. Clöter, however, was not discouraged by this
            misfortune. In December he called his adherents from Bavaria,
            Württemberg and Switzerland, together to a conference at
            Stuttgart, where they formed themselves into the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">German Exodus Church</span></em>.”</span> In
            the summer, 1880, Clöter himself travelled to South Russia and
            thought that he found in the Crimea the fittest place of refuge.
            On his return he was banished, but after some days liberated,
            though deprived of his clerical office. A final stop was then put
            to the exodus movement.</p>

            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Amen
            Community</span></em> owed its feeble existence to a Christian
            Jew, Israel Pick of Bohemia. Believing that he was not required
            in baptism to renounce his Judaism, but that rather thereby he
            first became a true Jew, through a onesided interpretation of Old
            Testament promises to his nation, he wished to found a colony of
            the people of God in the Holy Land on Jewish-Christian
            principles. The whole Mosaic law, excluding the observance of the
            Sabbath and circumcision, was to be the basis, together with
            baptism and the Lord's Supper, of ecclesiastical and civil
            organization. He succeeded in winning a few converts here and
            there, to whom he gave the name of the Amen Community, because in
            Christ (the אלהי אמן Isa. lxv. 16) all the prophecies of the old
            covenant are Yea and Amen. Its chief seat was at Munich-Gladbach.
            In 1859 Pick travelled to Palestine in order to choose a spot for
            the settlement of his followers and there all trace of him was
            lost.—4. The founder of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">German Temple Communities</span></em> in
            Palestine was Chr. Hoffmann, brother of General Superintendent
            Hoffmann of Berlin, and son of the founder of the Kornthal
            Community (<a href="#Section_196_Para_5" class="tei tei-ref">§
            196, 5</a>), in connection with Chr. Paulus, nephew of the well
            known Heidelberg professor Paulus (<a href="#Section_182_Para_2"
            class="tei tei-ref">§ 182, 2</a>). In 1854 they issued an
            invitation to a conference at Ludwigsburg, for consultation about
            the means for gathering the people of God in Palestine. A great
            crowd of believers from all parts, numbering some 10,000
            families, was to embark for the holy land to form there a new
            people of God which, on the foundation of prophets and apostles,
            should strictly practise the public law of the old covenant in
            all points of civil administration, including the laws of the
            sabbath and the jubilee. The conference besought of the German
            League that it would use its influence with the Sultan to secure
            permission for colonization with self-government and religious
            freedom. As the German League simply declined the request, the
            committee bought the estate of Kirschenhardthof near Marbach, in
            order there temporarily and in a small way to form a social
            commonwealth observing the Mosaic law. In 1858 Hoffmann went with
            two of his followers to Jerusalem in <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page438">[pg 438]</span><a name="Pg438" id="Pg438" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> order to look out a place there suitable
            for their purpose. The result was unsatisfactory. Therefore he
            issued in 1861 a summons to take part in a German Temple.
            Consequently a number of men from Württemberg, Bavaria, and
            Baden, Protestants and Catholics, forsook their churches,
            ordained priests and elders, and appointed Hoffmann their bishop
            and held regular synods. The final aim of this procedure,
            however, was always still to find a settlement in Palestine and
            erect a temple in Jerusalem which, according to prophecy, is to
            form the central sanctuary for the whole world. Colonization in
            the East was tried as a means to this end. Since 1869 there have
            been five organized colonies, with a Temple Chief and a
            congregational school, embracing about 1,000 souls, established
            in Palestine, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">viz.</span></span> at Jaffa, Haifa, Sarona,
            Beyrout, and in 1878 even in Jerusalem, whither the original
            colony at Jaffa was transferred. The German Imperial Government
            refused indeed in 1879 to give the recognition sought for to the
            civil and political organization of the Palestinian colonies, as
            in a foreign country beyond its jurisdiction, but granted to its
            Lyceum at Jerusalem a yearly contribution of 1,500 marks and to
            the schools of Jaffa, Haifa and Sarona from 650 to 1,000. In 1875
            Hoffmann published at Stuttgart a large apologetical and
            polemical work, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="de" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Occident und Orient</span></span>,”</span>
            which contained many thoughtful remarks. But since then, in the
            central organ of all the Temple Communities inspired by him, the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign"
            xml:lang="de"><span style="font-style: italic">Süddeutsche
            Warte</span></span>,”</span> he has openly and distinctly
            attached himself to Ebionitic rationalism, by denying and
            opposing the fundamental evangelical doctrine of the trinity,
            redemption, and the sacraments. These theological views, however,
            were by no means shared in by all the Templars, and caused a
            split in the community, one section at Haifa with the chief
            templar there, Hardegg, at its head, separating from the central
            body as an independent <span class="tei tei-q">“Imperial
            Brotherhood.”</span> The seceders, joined by many German and
            American templar friends, again drew nearer to the Evangelical
            church and ultimately became reconciled with it. But Hoffmann
            has, in his last work, <span lang="de" class="tei tei-foreign"
            xml:lang="de"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Bibelforschungen</span></span> i. ii.:

            Jerus.</span></span> 1882, 1884, carried his polemic against the

            in December, 1885. At the head of the denomination now stands his
            fellow-worker Paulus. From year to year several drop back into
            the Evangelical church so that the community is evidently
            approaching extinction.</p>

            occupied himself with plans for the improvement of the spiritual
            and material circumstances of his fellow-countrymen, at the
            outbreak of the persecution of the Jews in 1882 in South Russia
            eagerly urged their return to the holy land of their fathers and
            himself undertook a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page439">[pg
            439]</span><a name="Pg439" id="Pg439" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            journey of inspection. There definite shape seems to have been
            given to the long cherished thought of seeking the salvation of
            his people in an independent national attachment to their old
            sacred historical development, broken off 1850 years before, by
            acknowledging the Messiahship of Jesus. At least after his return
            he gave expression to the sentiment, based on Romans xi.:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The keys of the holy land are in the
            hands of our brother Jesus,”</span> which, in consequence of the
            high esteem in which he was held by his countrymen, was soon
            re-echoed by some 200 Jewish families. His main endeavour now was
            the formation of independent national Jewish-Christian
            communities, after the pattern of the primitive church of
            Jerusalem, as <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">New
            Israelites</span></em>,”</span> observing all the old Jewish
            rites and ordinances compatible with New Testament apostolic
            preaching and reconcilable with modern civil and social
            conditions. The Torah, the prophets of the Old Testament and the
            New Testament writings, are held as absolutely binding, whereas
            the Talmud and the post-apostolic Gentile Christian additions to
            doctrine, worship, and constitution are not so regarded. Jesus,
            Rabinowitsch teaches, is the true Messiah who, as Moses and
            prophets foretold, was born as Son of David by the Spirit of God
            and in the power of that Spirit lived and taught in Israel, then
            for our salvation suffered, was crucified and died, rose from the
            dead, and ascended to the right hand of the Father in heaven. The
            trinity of persons in God as well as the two natures in Christ he
            rejects, as not taught in the New Testament and originating in
            Gentile Christian speculation. Baptism and the Lord's Supper (and
            that <span class="tei tei-q">“according to the example of
            Christians of the pure Evangelical confession in England and
            Germany”</span>) are recognised as necessary means of grace; but
            the Lord's Supper is to be, according to its institution, a real
            meal with the old Jewish prayers. As to the doctrine of the
            Supper, Rabinowitsch agrees with the views of the Lutheran
            church. Circumcision and the observance of the Sabbath and the
            feasts (especially the Passover), are retained, not indeed as
            necessary to salvation, therefore not binding on Gentile
            Christians, but patriotically observed by Jewish-Christians as
            signs of their election from and before all nations as the people
            of God. In January, 1885, with consent of the Russian Government,
            the newly-erected synagogue of <span class="tei tei-q">“the holy
            Messiah Jesus Christ”</span> for the small congregation of
            Rabinowitsch's followers at Kishenev was solemnly opened, the
            Russian church authorities, the Lutheran pastor Fultin and many
            young Jews taking part in the service. Soon afterwards
            Rabinowitsch received Christian baptism in the chapel of the
            Bohemian church at Berlin at the hands of Prof. Mead of Andover,
            probably in recognition of the aid sent from America.—A
            Jewish-Christian religious communion with similar tendencies has
            been formed in the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page440">[pg

            "font-style: italic">The Catholic Apostolic Church of the
            Irvingites.</span></em>—Edward Irving, 1792-1834, a powerful and
            popular preacher of the Scotch-Presbyterian church in London,
            maintained the doctrine that the human nature of Christ like our
            own was affected by original sin, which was overcome and atoned
            for by the power of the divine nature. At the same time he became
            convinced that the spiritual gifts of the apostolic church could
            and should still be obtained by prayer and faith. A party of his
            followers soon began to exercise the gift of tongues by uttering
            unintelligible sounds, loud cries, and prophecies. His presbytery
            suspended him in 1832 and the General Assembly of the Church of
            Scotland excommunicated him. Rich and distinguished friends from
            the Episcopal church, among them the wealthy banker, Drummond,
            afterwards prominent as an apostle (died 1859), rallied round the
            man thus expelled from his church, and gave him the means to
            found a new church, but, in spite of Irving's protests, brought
            with them high church puseyite tendencies, which soon drove out
            the heretical as well as the puritanic tendencies, and modified
            the fanatical element into a hierarchical and liturgical
            formalism. The restoration of the office of apostle was the
            characteristic feature of the movement. After many unsuccessful
            attempts they succeeded by the divine illumination of the
            prophets in calling twelve apostles, first and chief of whom was
            the lawyer Cardale (died 1877). By the apostles, as chief rulers
            and stewards of the church, evangelists and pastors (or angels,
            Rev. ii. 1, 8, etc.) were ordained in accordance with Eph. iv.
            11; and subordinate to the pastors, there were appointed six
            elders and as many deacons, so that the office bearers of each
            congregation embraced thirteen persons, after the example of
            Christ and His twelve disciples. In London seven congregations
            were formed after the pattern of the seven apocalyptic churches
            (Rev. i. 20). Prominent among their new revelations was the
            promise of the immediately approaching advent of the Lord. The
            Lord, who was to have come in the lifetime of the first disciples
            and so was looked for confidently by them, delayed indefinitely
            His return on account of abounding iniquity and prevented the
            full development of the second apostolate designed for the
            Gentiles and meanwhile represented only by Paul, because the
            church was no longer worthy of it. Now at last, after eighteen
            centuries of degradation, in which the church came to be the
            apocalyptic Babylon and ripened for judgment, the time has come
            when the suspended apostolate has been restored to prepare the
            way for the last things. Very confidently was it at first
            maintained that none of their members should die, but should live
            to see the final consummation. But after death had removed so
            many from among them, and even the apostles <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page441">[pg 441]</span><a name="Pg441" id=
            "Pg441" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> one after another, it was
            merely said that those are already born who should see the last
            day. It may come any day, any hour. It begins with the first
            resurrection (Rev. xx. 5) and the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“changing”</span> of the saints that are alive (the
            wise virgins, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> the Irvingites), who will
            be caught up to the Lord in the clouds and in a higher sphere be
            joined with the Lord in the marriage supper of the Lamb. They are
            safely hidden while antichrist persecutes the other Christians,
            the foolish virgins, who only can be saved by means of painful
            suffering, and executes judgment on Babylon. This marks the end
            of the Gentile church; but then begins the conversion of the
            Jews, who, driven by necessity and the persecution of sinful men,
            have sought and found a refuge in Palestine. After a short
            victory of antichrist the Lord visibly appears among the risen
            and removed. The kingdom of antichrist is destroyed, Satan is
            bound, the saints live and reign with Christ a thousand years on
            the earth freed from the curse. Thereafter Satan is again let
            loose for a short time and works great havoc. Then comes Satan's
            final overthrow, the second resurrection and last judgment. Their
            liturgy, composed by the apostles, is a compilation from the
            Anglican and Catholic sources. Sacerdotalism and sacrifice are
            prominent and showy priestly garments are regarded as requisite.
            Yet they repudiate the Romish doctrine of the bloodless
            repetition of the bleeding sacrifice, as well as the doctrine of
            transubstantiation. But they strictly maintain the contribution
            of the tenth as a duty laid upon Christians by Heb. vii. 4. Their
            typical view of the Old Testament history and legislation,
            especially of the tabernacle, is most arbitrary and baseless.
            Their first published statement appeared in 1836 in an apostolic
            <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Letter to the Patriarchs, Bishops, and

            which was sent to the most prominent among those addressed, even
            to the pope, but produced no result. After this they began to
            prosecute their missionary work openly. But they gave their
            attention mainly to those already believers, and took no part in
            missions to the heathen, as they were sent neither to the heathen
            nor to unbelievers, but only to gather and save believers. In
            their native land of England, where at first they had great
            success, their day seems already past. In North America they
            succeeded in founding only two congregations. They prospered
            better in Germany and Switzerland, where they secured several
            able theologians, chief of all Thiersch, the professor of
            Theology in Marburg, the Tertullian of this modern Montanism
            (died 1885), and founded about eighty small congregations with
            some 5,000 members, chief of which are those of Berlin, Stettin,
            Königsberg, Leipzig, Marburg, Cassel, Basel, Augsburg, etc. Even
            among the Catholic clergy of Bavaria this movement found
            response; but that was checked by a series of depositions and
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page442">[pg 442]</span><a name=

            during 1857.—In 1882 the Lutheran pastor Alpers of Gehrden in
            Hanover was summoned to appear before the consistory to answer
            for his Irvingite views. He denied the charge and referred to his
            good Lutheran preaching. As, however, he had taken the
            sacramental <span class="tei tei-q">“sealing”</span> from
            Irvingite apostles, the court regarded this as proof of his
            having joined the party and so deposed him.<a id="noteref_126"

            would alone be saved, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            their absolute independentism form a complete contrast to the
            Irvingite hierarchism. John Darby, 1800-1882, first an advocate,
            then a clergyman of the Anglican church, breaking away from
            Anglicanism, founded between 1820 and 1830 a sectarian,
            apocalyptic, independent community at Plymouth (whence the name
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Plymouth Brethren</span></em>), but in 1838
            settled in Geneva, and in 1840 went to Canton Vaud, where
            Lausanne and Vevey have become the headquarters of the sect. All
            clerical offices, all ecclesiastical forms are of the evil one,
            and are evidence of the corruption of the church. There is only
            one office, the spiritual priesthood of all believers, and every
            believer has the right to preach and dispense the sacraments. Not
            only the Catholic, but also the Protestant church is a
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Balaam Church,”</span> and since the
            departure of the apostles no true church has existed. In doctrine

            days of Dan. viii. 14 as so many years, W. Miller of New York and
            Boston proclaimed in 1833 that the second advent would take place
            on the night of October 23rd, 1847, and convinced many thousands
            of the correctness of his calculations. When at last the night
            referred to arrived the believers continued assembled in their
            tabernacles waiting, but in vain, for the promise (Matt. xxiv.
            30, 31; 1 Cor. xv. 52; 1 Thess. iv. 16, 17), at <span class=

            This miscalculation, however, did not shake the Adventists'
            belief in the near approach of the Lord, but their number rather
            increased from year to year. Most zealous in propagating their

            Saints.</span></em>—Jos. Smith, a broken down farmer of Vermont,
            who took to knavish digging for hid treasures, affirmed in 1825,
            that under direction of divine revelations and visions, he had
            excavated on Comora hill in New York State, golden tablets in a
            stone kist on which sacred writings were engraved. A prophet's
            spectacles, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, two pierced stones which
            as a Mormon Urim and Thummim lay beside them, enabled him to
            understand and translate them. He published the translation in
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the Book of Mormon.”</span> According to
            this book, the Israelites of the ten tribes had migrated under
            their leader, Lehi, to America. There they divided into two
            peoples; the ungodly Lamanites, answering to the modern Redskins,
            and the pious Nephites. The latter preserved among them the old
            Israelitish histories and prophecies, and through miraculous
            signs in heaven and earth obtained knowledge of the birth of
            Christ that had meanwhile taken place. Toward the end of the
            fourth century after Christ, however, the Lamanites began a
            terrible war of extermination against the Nephites, in
            consequence of which the latter were rooted out with the
            exception of the prophet Mormon and his son Moroni. Mormon
            recorded his revelations on the golden tablets referred to, and
            concealed them as the future witness for the saints of the last
            days on the earth. Smith proclaimed himself now called on of God,
            on the basis of these documents and the revelations made to him,
            to found the church of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">The Latter Day Saints</span></em>. The widow
            of a preacher in New York proved indeed that the Book of Mormon
            was almost literally a plagiarism from a historico-didactic
            romance written by her deceased husband, Sal. Spaulding. The MS.
            had passed into the hands of Sidney Rigdon, formerly a Baptist
            minister and then a bookseller's assistant, subsequently Smith's
            right-hand man. But even this did not disturb the believers. In
            1831 Smith with his followers settled at Kirtland in Ohio. To
            avoid the daily increasing popular odium, he removed to Missouri,
            and thence to Illinois, and founded there, in 1840, the important
            town of Nauvoo with a beautiful temple. By diligence, industry
            and good discipline, the wealth, power and influence of their
            commonwealth increased, but in the same proportion the envy,
            hatred and prejudices of the people, which charged them with the
            most atrocious crimes. In 1844, to save bloodshed the governor
            ordered the two chiefs, Jos. and Hiram Smith, to surrender to
            voluntary imprisonment awaiting a regular trial. But furious
            armed mobs attacked the prison and shot down both. The roughs of
            the whole district then gathered in one great troop, destroyed
            the town of Nauvoo, burned the temple and drove out the
            inhabitants. These, now numbering 15,000 men, in several
            successive <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page444">[pg

            "tei tei-q">“through the wilderness”</span> over the Rocky
            Mountains, in order to erect for themselves a Zion on the other
            side. Smith's successor was the carpenter, Brigham Young. The
            journey occupied two full years, 1845-1847. In the great Salt
            Lake basin of Utah they founded <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Salt Lake
            City</span></em>, or the New Jerusalem, as the capital of their
            wilderness state <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Deseret</span></em>. The gold digging of the
            neighbouring state of California did not allure them, for their
            prophet told them that to pave streets, build houses and sow
            fields was better employment than seeking for gold. So here again
            they soon became a flourishing commonwealth.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><a name=

            recognised in them their own diabolic caricature, the Mormons
            restored the apostolic and prophetic office, insisted upon the
            continuance of the gift of tongues and miracles, expected the
            speedy advent of the Lord, reintroduced the payment of tithes,
            etc. But what distinguished them from all Christian sects was the
            proclamation of polygamy as a religious duty, on the plea that
            only those women who had been <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“sealed”</span> to a Latter-day Saint would share in
            the blessedness of life eternal. This was probably first
            introduced by Young in consequence of a new <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“divine revelation,”</span> but down to 1852 kept
            secret and denied before <span class="tei tei-q">“the
            Gentiles.”</span> The ambiguous book of Mormon was set meanwhile
            more and more in the background, and the teachings and prophecies
            of their prophet brought more and more to the front. <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“The Voice of Warning to all Nations”</span> of the
            zealous proselyte Parly Pratt, formerly a Campbellite preacher,
            exercised a great influence in spreading the sect. But the most
            gifted of them all was Orson Pratt, Rigdon's successor in the
            apostolate. To him mainly is ascribed the construction of its
            later, highly fantastic religious system which, consisting of
            elements gathered from Neo-platonism, gnosticism, and other forms
            of theosophical mysticism, embraces all the mysteries of time and
            eternity. Its fundamental ideas are these: There are gods without
            number; all are polygamists and their wives are sharers of their
            glory and bliss. They are the fathers of human souls who here on
            earth ripen for their heavenly destiny. Jesus is the first born
            son of the highest god by his first wife; he was married on earth
            to Mary Magdalene, the sisters Martha and Mary and other women.
            Those saints who here fulfil their destiny become after death
            gods, while they are arranged according to their merit in various
            ranks and with prospect of promotion to higher places. At the end
            of this world's course, Jesus will come again, and, enthroned in
            the temple of Salt Lake City, exercise judgment against all
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Gentiles”</span> and apostates, etc.—The
            constitution of the Mormon State is essentially theocratic. At
            the head stood the president, Brigham Young, as prophet,
            patriarch, and priest-king, in whose <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page445">[pg 445]</span><a name="Pg445" id="Pg445" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> hands are all the threads of the spiritual
            as well as secular administration. A high council alongside of
            him, consisting of seventy members, as also the prophets and
            apostles, bishops and elders, and generally the whole richly
            organized hierarchy, are only the pliable instruments of his
            all-commanding will. Every one on entering the society surrenders
            his whole property, and after that contributes a tenth of his
            yearly income and personal labour to the common purse of the
            community. Soon numerous missionaries were sent forth who crossed
            the Atlantic, and attained great success, especially in Scotland,
            England and Scandinavia, but also in North-West Germany and in
            Switzerland. On removing the misunderstanding that prevailed
            about their social and political condition, and supplying the
            penniless out of the rich immigration fund with the means to make
            the journey, they persuaded great crowds of their new converts to
            accompany them to Utah.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><a name=
            "Section_211_Para_14" id="Section_211_Para_14" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> 14. In 1849 the Mormons had asked Congress
            for the apportioning of the district colonized by them as an
            independent and autonomous <span class="tei tei-q">“State”</span>
            in the union, but were granted, in 1850, only the constitution of
            a <span class="tei tei-q">“territory”</span> under the central
            government at Washington, and the appointment of their patriarch,
            Young, as its governor. Accustomed to absolute rule, in two years
            he drove out all the other officers appointed by the union. He
            was then deprived of office, but the new governor, Col. Sefton,
            appointed in 1854, with the small armament supplied him could not
            maintain his position and voluntarily retired. When afterwards in
            1858 Governor Cumming, appointed by president Buchanan, entered
            Utah with a strong military force, Young armed for a decisive
            struggle. A compromise, however, was effected. A complete amnesty
            was granted to the saints, the soldiers of the union entered
            peacefully into the Salt-Lake City, and Young assumed tolerably
            friendly relations with the governor, who, nevertheless, by the
            erection of a fort commanding the city made the position safe for
            himself and his troops. On the outbreak of the war of Secession
            in 1861 the troops of the union were for the most part withdrawn.
            But all the more energetically did the central government at the
            close of the war in 1865 resolve upon the complete subjugation of
            the rebel saints, having learnt that since 1852 numerous murders
            had taken place in the territory, and that the disappearance of
            whole caravans of colonists was not due to attacks of Indians,
            who would have scalped their victims, but to a secret Mormon
            fraternity called Danites (Judges xviii.), brothers of Gideon
            (Judges vi. ff.) or Angels of Destruction, which, obedient to the
            slightest hint from the prophet, had undertaken to avenge by
            bloody terrorism any sign of resistance to his authority, to
            arrest any tendency to apostasy, and to guard against the
            introduction of any <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page446">[pg
            446]</span><a name="Pg446" id="Pg446" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            foreign element. The Union Pacific Railway opened in 1869
            deprived the <span class="tei tei-q">“Kingdom of God”</span> of
            its most powerful protection, its geographical isolation, while
            the rich silver mines discovered at the same time in Utah,
            peopled city and country with immense flocks of <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Gentiles.”</span> The nemesis, which brought the
            Mormon bishop Lee, twenty years after the deed, under the lash of
            the high court of justiciary as involved in the horrible massacre
            of a large party of emigrants at Mountain Meadows in 1857, would
            probably have also befallen the prophet himself as the main
            instigator of this and many other crimes had he not by a sudden
            death two months later, in his seventy-fifth year, escaped the
            jurisdiction of any earthly tribunal (died 1877). A successor was
            not chosen, but supreme authority is in the hands of the college
            of twelve apostles with the elder John Taylor at their
            head.—Repeated attempts made since 1874 by the United States
            authorities by penal enactments to root out polygamy among the
            Mormons have always failed, because its actual existence could
            never be legally proved. The witness called could or would say
            nothing, since the <span class="tei tei-q">“sealing”</span> was
            always secretly performed, and the women concerned denied that a
            marriage had been entered into with the accused, or if one
            confessed herself his married wife she refused to give any
            evidence about his domestic relations.—Recently a split has
            occurred among the Mormons. By far the larger party is that of
            the <span class="tei tei-q">“Salt Lake Mormons,”</span> which
            holds firmly by polygamy and all the other institutions
            introduced by Young and since his time. The other party is that
            of the Kirtland, or Old Mormons, headed by the son of their
            founder, Jos. Smith, who had been passed over on account of his
            youth, which repudiates all these as unsupported novelties and
            restores the true Mormonism of the founder. The Old Mormons not
            only oppose polygamy, but also all more recently introduced
            doctrines. They are called Kirtland Mormons from the first temple
            built by their founder at Kirtland in 1814, which having fallen
            into ruins, was restored by Geo. Smith, jun., and became the
            centre of the Old Mormon denomination. In April 1885 they held
            there their first synod, attended by 200 deputies.<a id=

            "font-style: italic">The Taepings in
            China.</span></em>—Hung-sen-tsenen, born in 1813 in the province
            of Shan-Tung, was destined for the learned profession but failed
            in his examination at Canton. There he first, in 1833, came into
            contact with Protestant missionaries, whose misunderstood words
            awakened in him the belief that he was called to perform great
            things. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page447">[pg
            447]</span><a name="Pg447" id="Pg447" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            At the same time he there got possession of some Christian
            Chinese tracts. Failing in his examination a second time in 1837,
            he fell into a dangerous illness and had a series of visions in
            which an old man with a golden beard appeared, handing to him the
            insignia of imperial rank, and commanding him to root out the
            demons. After his recovery he became an elementary teacher. A
            relative called Li visited him in 1843. The Christian tracts were
            again sought out and carefully studied. Sen now recognised in the
            old man of his visions the God of the Christians and in himself
            the younger brother of Jesus. The two baptized one another and
            won over two young relatives to their views. Expelled from their
            offices, they went in 1844 to the province of Kiang Se as pencil
            and ink sellers, preached diligently the new doctrine and founded
            numerous small congregations of their sect. The American
            missionaries at Canton heard of the success of their preaching,
            and Sen accepted an invitation to join them in 1847. The
            missionary Roberts had a great esteem for him and intended to
            baptize him, when in consequence of stories spread about him
            their relations became strained. Sen now returned in 1848 to his
            companions in Kiang Se, who had diligently and successfully
            continued their preaching. In 1850 they began to attract
            attention by the violent destruction of idols. When now all the
            remnants of a pirate band joined them as converts, they were in
            common with these persecuted by the government and proclaimed
            rebels. The expulsion of the hated Mantshu dynasty, which two
            hundred years before had displaced the Ming dynasty, and the
            overthrow of idolatry were now their main endeavour, and in 1857
            they organized under Sen a regular rebellion for the setting up
            of a Taeping dynasty, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, of universal peace. The
            Taeping army advanced unhindered, all Mantschu soldiers who fell
            into its hands were massacred, and of the inhabitants of the
            provinces conquered, only those were spared who joined their
            ranks. In March, 1853, they stormed the second capital of the
            empire, Nankin, the old residence of the Ming dynasty. There Sen
            fixed his residence and styled himself Tien-Wang, the Divine
            Prince. He assigned to ten subordinate princes the government of
            the conquered provinces, almost the half of the immense empire.
            Thousands of bibles were circulated; the ten commandments
            proclaimed as the foundation of law, many writings, prayers and
            poems composed for the instruction of the people, and these with
            the bible made subjects of examination for entrance to the
            learned order. An Arian theory of the trinity was set forth; the
            Father is the one personal God, whose likeness in bodily human
            form Sen strictly forbade, destroying the Catholic images as well
            as the Chinese idols. Jesus is the first-born son of God, yet not
            himself God, sent by the Father into the world in order to
            enlighten it by his doctrine and to redeem it by his <span class=

            "Pg448" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> atoning sufferings. Sen, the
            younger brother of Jesus, was sent into the world to spread the
            doctrine of Jesus and to expel the demons, the Mantschu dynasty.
            Reception takes place through baptism. The Lord's Supper was
            unknown to them. Bloody and bloodless offerings were still
            tolerated. The use of wine and tobacco was forbidden; the use of
            opium and trafficking in it were punished with death. But
            polygamy was sanctioned. Saturday, according to the Old
            Testament, was their holy day. Their service consisted only of
            prayer, singing and religious instruction; but also written
            prayers were presented to God by burning.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><a name=
            "Section_211_Para_16" id="Section_211_Para_16" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> 16. Sen himself had no more visions after
            1837. But other ecstatic prophets arose, the eastern prince Yang
            and the western prince Siao. The revelations of the latter were
            comparatively sober, but those of the former were in the highest
            degree blasphemously fanatical. He declared himself the Paraclete
            promised by Jesus, and taught that God himself, as well as Jesus,
            had a wife with sons and daughters. He was at the same time a
            brave and successful general, and the mass of the Taepings were
            enthusiastically attached to him. Sen humbly yielded to the
            extravagances of this fanatic, even when Yang sentenced him to
            receive forty lashes. Sen's overthrow was already resolved upon
            in Yang's secret council, when Sen took courage and gave the
            northern prince secret orders to murder Yang and his followers in
            one night. This was done, and Sen was weak enough to allow the
            executioner of his secret order to be publicly put to death so as
            to appease the excited populace. But he thus again in 1856 became
            master of the situation.—One of the oldest apostles of Sen, his
            near relative Hung Yin, had been turned off at Hong Kong. He
            there attached himself to the Basel missionary, Hamberg, who in
            1852 baptized him and made him his native helper. In hope of
            winning his cousin to the true Christian faith, he travelled in
            1854 to Nankin, which however he did not reach till January,
            1859. Sen received him gladly and made him his war minister. But
            his efforts to introduce a purer Christianity among the Taepings
            were unsuccessful, for he tried the slippery way of
            accommodation, and under pressure from Sen set up for himself a
            harem. In October, 1860, on Sen's repeated invitation, his former
            teacher, the missionary Roberts of Nankin, arrived and was
            immediately made minister for foreign affairs. The Shanghai
            missionaries, several of whom visited Nankin, had interesting
            interviews with Yin in 1860, but not with the emperor, as they
            refused to go on their knees before him. They were encouraged by
            Yin to hope for a future much needed purifying of Taeping
            Christianity. Yang's revelations, however, held their ground
            after as well as before, and were increased by further
            absurdities. To such crass fanaticism was now added the inhuman
            cruelty with which they massacred the <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page449">[pg 449]</span><a name="Pg449" id="Pg449" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> vanquished and wasted the conquered cities
            and districts. Had the European powers ranged themselves in a
            friendly and peaceful attitude alongside of the Taepings, China
            might now have been a Christian empire. Instead of this the
            English, on account of the extreme opposition of the Taepings to
            the opium traffic, took up a hostile position toward them, while
            they were also in disfavour with the French, who had been
            denounced by them as idolaters on account of their Romish image
            worship. Down to the beginning of 1862, however, Yin's influence
            had prevented any hostile proceedings against the Europeans in
            spite of many provocations given. But after that the Taepings
            refused them any quarter. Roberts fled by night to save his life.
            Against disciplined European troops the rebels could not hold
            their ground. One city after another was taken from them, and at
            last, in July 1864, their capital Nankin. Sen was found poisoned
            in his burning palace.<a id="noteref_129" name="noteref_129"

            shoemaker's apprentice, Andrew Jackson Davis of Poughkeepsie on
            the Hudson, in his nineteenth year fell into a magnetic sleep and
            composed his first work, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Principles
            of Nature, Her Divine Revelations and a Voice to Mankind,”</span>
            in 1845. He declared its utterances to be spiritual revelations
            from the other world. But his later writings composed in working
            hours made the same claim, especially the five volume work,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Great Harmonia, being a Philosophical
            Revelation of the Natural, Spiritual, and Celestial
            Universe,”</span> 1850 ff. Both went through numerous editions
            and were translated into German. The great spiritual
            manifestation promised in the first work was not long delayed. In
            a house bought by the family of Fox in Hydesville in New York
            State a spectral knocking was often heard. Through the
            intercourse which the two youngest daughters, aged nine and
            twelve years, had with the ghosts, the skeleton of a murdered
            five years' old child of a pedlar was discovered buried in the
            cellar, and when the family soon thereafter left the house, the
            ghosts went with them and continued their communications by table
            turning, table rapping, table writing, etc. The thing now became
            epidemic. Hundreds and thousands of male and female <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">mediums</span></em> arose and held an
            extremely lively and varied intercourse with innumerable departed
            ones of earlier and later times. The believers soon numbered
            millions, including highly educated persons of all ranks, even
            such exact chemists as Mapes and Hare. An abundant literature in
            books and journals, as well as Sunday services, frequent
            camp-meetings and annual congresses formed a propaganda for the
            alleged <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page450">[pg
            450]</span><a name="Pg450" id="Pg450" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            spiritualism, which soon found its way across the ocean and won
            enthusiastic adherents for all confessions in all European
            countries, especially in London, Paris, Brussels, St. Petersburg,
            Vienna, Dresden, Leipzig, etc. They now broke up into two parties
            called respectively Spiritualists and Spiritists. The former put
            in the foreground physical experiments with astonishing results
            and miraculous effects; the latter, with the Frenchman Allan
            Kardec (<span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
            "fr"><span style="font-style: italic">Rivail</span></span>) as
            their leader, give prominence to the teaching of spirits by
            direct communication. The former in reference to the origin of
            the human soul held by the theory of traducianism; the latter to
            that of pre-existence in connection with a doctrine of
            re-incarnation of spirits by reason of growing purity and
            perfection. The latter see in Christ the incarnation of a spirit
            of the highest order; the former merely the purest and most
            perfect type of human nature. But neither admit the real central
            truth of Christianity, the reconciliation of sinful humanity with
            God in Christ. Both evaporate the resurrection into a mere
            spectral spirit manifestation; and the disclosures and utterances
            of the spirits with both are equally trivial, silly, and vain.—In
            England the famous palæontologist and collaborateur of Darwin,
            Alfr. Russel Wallace, and the no less celebrated physicist Wm.
            Crookes, are apologists of spiritualism. The latter declared in
            1879 that to the three well-known conditions of matter, solid,
            fluid and gaseous, should be added a fourth, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“radiant,”</span> and that there is the borderland
            where force and matter meet. And in Germany the acute Leipzig
            astrophysicist Fr. Zöllner, after a whole series of
            spiritualistic séances conducted by the American medium Slade in
            1877 and 1878 had been carefully scrutinized and tested by
            himself and several of his most accomplished scientific
            colleagues, was convinced of the existence and reality of higher
            <span class="tei tei-q">“four dimension”</span> space in the
            spirit world, to which by reason of its fourth dimension the
            power belonged of passing through earthly bodily matter. The
            philosophers I. H. Fichte of Stuttgart and Ulrici of Halle have
            admitted the reality of spiritualistic communications and allege
            them as proofs of immortality. Among German theologians Luthardt
            of Leipzig regards it all as the work of demons who take
            advantage for their own ends of the moral-religious dissolution
            of the modern world and its consequent nerve shaking that
            prevails, just as in the ancient world in the beginnings of
            Christianity. Zöckler of Greifswald finds an analogy between it
            and the demoniacal possession of New Testament times; so too
            Martensen in his <span class="tei tei-q">“Jacob Boehme,”</span>
            and on the Catholic side W. Schneider; while Splittgerber refers
            most of the manifestations in question to a merely subjective
            origin in <span class="tei tei-q">“the right side of the human
            soul life,”</span> but puts the materialization of spirits in the
            category of delusive jugglery. Spiritualism has scarcely rallied
            from the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page451">[pg
            451]</span><a name="Pg451" id="Pg451" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            obloquy cast upon it by the unmasking of the tricks of the famous
            medium Miss Florence Cook in London in 1880 and of the
            distinguished spirit materialiser Bastian by the Grand-duke John
            of Austria in 1884.<a id="noteref_130" name="noteref_130" href=

            illusion belongs also the spiritualistic movement of Indian
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Theosophism</span></em> or <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Occultism</span></em>. The American Col.
            Olcott of New York had already moved for twenty-two years in
            spiritualist circles when in 1874 he met with Madame Blavatsky,
            widow of a Russian general who had been governor of Erivan in
            Armenia. She professed to have been from her eighth year in
            communication with spirits, then to have had secret intercourse
            with the Mahatmas, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> spirits of old Indian
            penitents, during a seven years' residence on the Himalayas. She
            now promised to introduce the colonel to them. Olcott and
            Blavatsky founded at New York in 1875 a society for research in
            the department of the mystic sciences, travelled in 1878 to
            Further India and Ceylon, and settled finally in Madras, whence
            by word and writing they proclaimed through the whole land
            theosophism or occultism as the religion of the future, which,
            consisting in a medley of Hinduism and Buddhism, enriched by
            spiritualistic revelations of Mahatmas, vouched for by
            spiritualistic signs and miracles and conformed to the most
            recent philosophical and scientific researches in America and
            Europe, aimed at heaping contempt upon Christianity and finally
            driving it from the field. As fanatical opponents of Christian
            missions in India they were strongly supported by the Brahman and
            Buddhist hierarchy, and soon obtained for the theosophical
            society founded by them not only numerous adherents from among
            the natives but also many Englishman befooled by their
            spiritualistic swindle. As apostle and literary pioneer of the
            new religion appeared an Anglo-Indian called Sinnett. In spring,
            1884, Madame Blavatsky and Col. Olcott went on a propagandist
            tour to Europe, where, in England, France, Austria, and Hungary,
            they won many converts, while Col. Olcott at Elberfeld and Madame
            Blavatsky at Odessa founded branches of their theosophical
            society.—But meanwhile in <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page452">[pg 452]</span><a name="Pg452" id="Pg452" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> India affairs assumed a threatening aspect.
            Blavatsky on her departure had entrusted the keys of her dwelling
            and her mysterious cabinet with its various panels, falling
            doors, etc., to Mr. and Mrs. Coulomb, who had been hitherto her
            assistants in all her juggleries. Madame Coulomb, however,
            quarrelled with the board of theosophists at Madras, and revenged
            herself by placing in the hands of the Scottish mission letters
            addressed by Blavatsky to herself and her husband which supplied
            evidence that all her spiritualistic manifestations were only
            common tricks. In addition she gave public exhibitions in which
            she demonstrated to the spectators <span lang="la" class=
            "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">ad oculos</span></span> the spiritual
            manifestations of the Mahatmas, and subsequently published an
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Account of My Acquaintanceship with
            Madame Blavatsky, 1872-1884,”</span> with discoveries of her
            earlier rogueries. Meanwhile the swindler had herself in
            December, 1884, returned to Madras in company with several
            believers gathered up in England, among others a young English
            clergyman, Leadbeater, who some days previously in Ceylon had
            formally adopted Buddhism. The theosophists now demanded that the
            reputed cheat and deceiver should be brought before a civil
            court. The president, however, declared that the investigations
            and judgment of a profane court of law could not be accepted to
            the mysteries of occultism, but promised a careful examination by
            a commission appointed by himself, and Blavatsky thought it
            advisable <span class="tei tei-q">“for the restoration of her
            health in a cooler climate”</span> to make off from the scene of
            conflict.<a id="noteref_131" name="noteref_131" href=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While the
            antichristian spirit of the age breaks out in various theoretical
            forms in our literature, there also abound social and communistic
            movements of a practical kind. Socialism and communism both aim
            at a thorough-going reform of the rights of property and
            possession in strict proportion to the labour spent thereon. They
            are, however, distinguished in this, that while communism
            declares war against all private property and demands absolute
            community of goods, socialism, at least in its older and nobler
            forms, proceeding from the idea of precise correspondence between
            capital and labour, seeks to have expression given to this in
            fact. From the older socialism, which endeavoured to reach
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page453">[pg 453]</span><a name=
            "Pg453" id="Pg453" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> its end in a
            peaceful way within the existing lines of civil order, a later
            social democracy is to be distinguished by its decidedly
            politico-revolutionary character and tendency to attach itself
            more to communism. This modern socialism thinks to open the way
            to the realization of its hare-brained ideas by the confusion and
            overthrow of existing law and order.</p>

            "font-style: italic">The Beginnings of Modern
            Communism.</span></em>—As early as 1796 Babeuf published in Paris
            a communistic manifesto which maintained the thesis that natural
            law gives all men an equal right to the enjoyment of all goods.
            His ideas were subsequently systematized and developed by
            Fourier, Proudhon, Cabet, and Louis Blanc in France, and by
            Weibling and Stirner in Germany. In a treatise of 1840 Proudhon
            answered the question, <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign"
            xml:lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">Qu'est-ce que la
            propriété?</span></span> in words which afterwards became
            proverbial, and formed the motto of communism: <span lang="fr"
            class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">La propriété c'est le vol.</span></span> But
            the mere negation of property affords no permanent standing
            ground. All altars must be thrown down; all religion rooted out
            as the plague of humanity; the family and marriage, as the
            fountain of all selfishness, must be abolished; all existing
            governments must be overthrown; all Europe must be turned into
            one great social democracy. A secret communistic propaganda
            spread over all western Europe, had its head centres in Belgium
            and Switzerland, crossed the Alps and the Pyrenees, as well as
            the Channel, and found a congenial soil even in Russia.</p>

            Simon of Paris, reduced to poverty by speculation, proposed by
            means of a thorough organization of industry to found a new and
            happy state of things in which there would be pure enjoyment
            without poverty and care. An attempted suicide, which led however
            to his death in 1825, made him in the eyes of his disciples a
            saviour of the world. The July revolution of 1830 gave to the new
            universal religion, which reinstated the flesh in its long lost
            rights and sought to assign to each individual the place in the
            commonwealth for which he was fitted, some advantage.

            St. Simonism soon excited public ridicule, was pronounced immoral
            by the courts of justice, and the remnants of its votaries fled
            from the scorn of the people and the vengeance of the law to

            there, unhindered by religious prejudices, clerical opposition,
            and police interference, to work out on a large scale his
            socialistic schemes for improving the world, which in a small way
            he believed he had proved already among his Scotch
            mill-operatives. He bought for this purpose from the
            Württemberger Rapp the colony of Harmony (<a href=
            "#Section_211_Para_6" class="tei tei-ref">§ 211, 6</a>); but
            wanting the necessary capital for the socialistic commonwealth
            there established, and failing to realize his expectations,
            discontent, disorder, and opposition got the upper hand, and in
            1826 Owen was obliged to abandon all his property. He now
            returned to England, and addressed himself in treatises, tracts,
            and lectures to the working classes of the whole land, in order
            to win them over to his ideas. A vast brotherhood for mutual
            benefit and for the enjoyment of their joint earnings was to put
            an end to earth's misery, which the positive religions had not
            lessened but only increased. In 1836, in the great industrial
            cities socialist unions with nearly half a million members were
            formed, with their head centre and annual congress at Birmingham.
            The practical schemes of Owen, however, had no success in
            England, and his societies no permanency. He died in 1858.—Still
            more disastrous was the fate of the Icarian Colony, founded in
            Texas in 1848 by the Frenchman <em class=

            communistic-philanthropic ideas on the other side of the
            Atlantic. The colonists soon found their sanguine hopes bitterly
            disappointed, and hurled against their leader reproaches and
            threats. Some ex-Icarians accused him in 1849 before the Paris
            police-court as a swindler, and he was condemned to two years'
            imprisonment and five years' loss of civil privileges. Cabet now
            hastened to France, and on appeal obtained reversion of his
            sentence in 1851. Returning to America, he founded a new Icarian
            colony at Nauvoo in Illinois. But there, too, everything went
            wrong, and a revolt of the colonists obliged him to flee. He died

            England, France, and Germany. The idea of a union embracing the
            whole world was first broached at the great London Exhibition in
            1862, and at a conference in London on September 28th, 1864, at
            which all industrial countries of Europe were represented, it
            assumed a practical shape by the founding of a universal
            international working-men's association. Its constitution was

            eight sections, English, American, French, German, Belgian,
            Dutch, Italian, and Spanish, and annual international congresses
            at Geneva, Lausanne, Brussels, Basel, and the Hague gave
            opportunity for general consultation on matters of common
            interest. Reception as members was granted by the giving of a
            diploma after six months' trial, and involved unconditional
            obedience to the statutes and ordinances of the central
            authorities and the payment of an annual fee. The number of
            members, not, however, exclusively drawn from the working
            classes, is said to have reached two and a half millions. The
            society adopted the current socialistic and communistic ideas and
            tendencies. The religious principle of the association was
            therefore: atheism and materialism; the political: absolute
            democracy; the social: equal rights of labour and profit, with
            abolition of private property, hereditary rights, marriage, and
            family; and as means for realizing this programme,
            unaccomplishable by peaceable methods, revolution and rebellion,
            fire and sword, poison, petroleum and dynamite. Such means have
            been used already in various ways by the international throughout
            the Romance countries; but specially in the brief Reign of Terror
            of the Paris Commune, March and April, 1871, in the relatively no
            less violent attempted revolt at Alcoy in Southern Spain in July,
            1873. But meanwhile differences appeared within the society,
            which were formulated at the Hague Congress in 1872, and led to
            splits, which greatly lessened its unity, influence, and power to
            do mischief, so that this congress may perhaps be regarded as the
            first beginning of its end.<a id="noteref_133" name="noteref_133"

            Democracy.</span></em>—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Ferd. Lassalle</span></em>, son of a rich
            Jewish merchant of Breslau, after a full course of study in
            philosophy and law, began in 1848 to take a lively part in the
            advanced movements of the age, and when he found among the
            liberal citizens no favour for his socialistic ideas turned
            exclusively to the working classes. In answer to the question as
            to what was to be done, by the central committee of a
            working-men's congress at Leipzig, he wrought out in 1863 with
            great subtlety in an open letter the fundamental idea of his
            universal redemption. All plans of self-help to relieve the
            distress of working men hitherto proposed (specially that of
            Schulze-Delitzsch) break down over the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“iron economic law of wages,”</span> in consequence
            of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page456">[pg 456]</span><a name=
            "Pg456" id="Pg456" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> which under the
            dominion of capital and the large employers of labour wages are
            always with fatalistic necessity reduced to the point
            indispensable for supplying a working man's family with the
            absolute necessaries of life. The working classes, however, have
            the right according to the law of nature to a full equivalent for
            their labour, but in order to reach this they must be their own
            undertakers, and where self-help is only a vain illusion, state
            help must afford the means. By insisting on the right to
            universal suffrage the working classes have obtained a decided
            majority in the legislative assemblies, and there secured a
            government of the future in accordance with their needs. On these
            principles the Universal German Society of Working Men was
            constituted, with Lassalle as its president, which position he
            held till his death in a duel in 1864. Long internal disputes and
            personal recriminations led to a split at the Eisenach Congress
            in 1869. The malcontents founded an independent <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Social Democratic Working-Men's Union,”</span> under
            the leadership of Bebel and Liebknecht, which, particularly
            successful in Saxony, Brunswick, and South Germany, represents
            itself as the German branch of the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“International Working-Men's Association.”</span> It
            adhered indeed generally to Lassalle's programme, but objected to
            the extravagant adulation claimed for Lassalle by their
            opponents, the proper disciples of Lassalle, who had Hasenclaver
            as their leader and Berlin as their headquarters, substituted a
            federal for a centralistic organization, and instead of a great
            centralised government in the future desired rather a federal
            republic embracing all Europe. But both declared equally in
            favour of revolution; they vied with one another in bitter hatred
            of everything bearing the name of religion; and wrought out with
            equal enthusiasm their communistic schemes for the future. At the
            Gotha Congress of 1875 a reconciliation of parties was effected.
            The social-democratic agitation thus received a new impulse and
            assumed threatening proportions. Yet it required such
            extraordinary occurrences as the twice attempted assassination of
            the aged emperor, by Hodel on May 11th, and Nobiling on June 2nd,
            1878, to rouse the government to legislative action. On the basis
            of a law passed in October, 1878, for two and a half years (but
            in May, 1880, continued for other three and a half years, and in
            May, 1884, and again in April, 1886, on each occasion extended to
            other two years), 200 socialist societies throughout the German
            empire were suppressed, sixty-four revolutionary journals,
            circulated in hundreds of thousands and with millions of readers,
            and about 800 other seditious writings, were forbidden. But that
            the social-democratic organization and agitation was not thereby
            destroyed is proved by the fact that in August, 1880, in an
            uninhabited Swiss castle lent for the purpose, in Canton Zürich,
            a congress was held, attended by fifty-six German socialists,
            with <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page457">[pg
            457]</span><a name="Pg457" id="Pg457" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            greetings by letter from sympathisers in all European countries,
            which among other things passed the resolution unanimously, no
            longer as had been agreed upon at Gotha, to seek their ends by
            lawful methods, as by the law of the socialists impossible, but
            by the way of revolution.—On the other hand, the German Imperial
            Chancellor Prince Bismarck in the Reichstag, 1884, fully admitted
            the <span class="tei tei-q">“right of the worker to work,”</span>
            as well as the duty of the state to ameliorate the condition of
            working men as far as possible, and in three propositions:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Work for the healthy workman, hospital
            attendance to the sick, and maintenance to the invalided,”</span>
            granted all that is asked for by a healthy social policy.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><a name=

            "tei tei-anchor"></a> 6. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Russian Nihilism.</span></em>—In Russia,
            too, notwithstanding a strictly exercised censorship, the
            philosophico-scientific gospel of materialism and atheism found
            entrance through the writings of Moleschott, Feuerbach, Büchner,
            Darwin, etc. (<a href="#Section_174_Para_3" class="tei tei-ref">§
            174, 3</a>), especially among the students. In 1860, Nihilism,
            springing from this seed, first assumed the character of a
            philosophical and literary movement. It sought the overthrow of
            all religious institutions. Then came the women's question,
            claiming emancipation for the wife. The example of the Paris
            Commune of 1871 contributed largely to the development of
            Nihilistic idealism, its political revolutionary socialism. The
            Nihilist propaganda, like an epidemic, now seized upon the
            academic youth, male and female, was spread in aristocratic
            families by tutors and governesses, won secret disciples among
            civil servants as well as officers of the army and navy, and was
            enthusiastically supported by ladies in the most cultured and
            exalted ranks. In order to spread its views among the people,
            young men and women disguised in peasant's dress went out among
            the peasants and artisans, lived and wrought like them, and
            preached their gospel to them in their hours of rest. But their
            efforts failed through the antipathy and apathy of the lower
            orders, and the energetic interference of the government by
            imprisonment and banishment thinned the ranks of the
            propagandists. But all the more closely did those left bind
            themselves together under their central leaders as the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Society for Country and Freedom,”</span>
            and strove with redoubled eagerness to spread revolutionary
            principles by secretly printing their proclamations and other
            incendiary productions, and scattering them in the streets and
            houses. On January 24th, 1878, the female Nihilist <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Vera
            Sassulitsch</span></em> from personal revenge dangerously wounded
            with a revolver General Trepoff, the dreaded head of the St.
            Petersburg police. Although she openly avowed the deed before the
            court and gloried in it, she was amid the acclamations of the
            public acquitted. This was the hour when Nihilism exercised its
            fellest terrorism. The fair, peaceful phrase, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“To work, fight, suffer, and die for the
            people,”</span> was silenced; it was now, sword and <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page458">[pg 458]</span><a name="Pg458" id=
            "Pg458" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> fire, dagger and revolver,
            dynamite and mines for all oppressors of the people, but above
            all for the agents of the police, for their spies, for all
            informers and apostates. An <span class="tei tei-q">“executive
            committee,”</span> unknown to most of the conspirators
            themselves, issued the death sentence; the lot determined the
            executioner, who himself suffered death if he failed to
            accomplish it. What was now aimed at was the assassination of
            higher state officials; then the sacred person of the emperor.
            Three bold attempts at assassination miscarried; the revolver
            shot of Solowjews on April 14th, 1879; the mine on the railway
            near Moscow that exploded too late on November 30th, 1879; the
            horrible attempt to blow up the Winter Palace with the emperor
            and his family on February 17th, 1880; but the fourth, a dynamite
            bomb thrown between the feet of the emperor on March 13th, 1881,
            destroyed the life of this noble and humane monarch, who in
            1861-1863 had freed his people from the yoke of serfdom. As for
            years nothing more had been heard of Nihilist attempts, it was
            hoped that the government had succeeded in putting down this
            diabolical rebellion, but in 1887 the news spread that an equally
            horrible attempt had been planned for the sixth anniversary of
            the assassination of Alexander II., but fortunately timely
            precautions were taken against it.</p>

          Basel the seventeenth down to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

              Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
              public support and donations to carry out its mission of
              increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that
              can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible
              by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
              Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important
              to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
              Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
              charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the
              United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it
              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the
              status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href=

              cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
              International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
              make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations
              received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp
              our small staff.</p>
